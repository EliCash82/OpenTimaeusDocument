CAST:
SOKRATES, TlMAEUS, HERMOKRATES, KRITIAS.

I. Sokrates. One, two, three what is become of the fourth,
my dear Timaeus, of our yesterday's guests and our entertainers
of to-day ?

Timaeus. He has fallen sick, Sokrates : he would not will-
ingly have been missing at this gathering.

Sokrates. Then it is for you and your companions, is it not,
to fulfil the part of our absent friend ?

Timaeus. Unquestionably; and we will omit nothing that
lies in our power. For indeed it would not be fair, seeing
how well we were entertained by you yesterday, that the rest
of us should not heartily requite you with a fitting return of
hospitality.

Sokrates. Do you remember the extent and scope of the
subjects I appointed for your discussion ?

Timaeus. In part we remember; and whatever we have
forgotten, you are here to aid our memory. But I should
prefer, if it is not troublesome, that you should briefly recapitu-
late them from beginning to end, that they may be more firmly
fixed in our minds.

Sokrates. I will. The main subject of my discourse
yesterday was a political constitution, and the kind of prin-
ciples and citizens which seemed to me likely to render it most
perfect.

Timaeus. Yes, and what you said, Sokrates, was very much
to the satisfaction of us all.

Sokrates. Was not our first step to separate the agricultural
class and tradesmen in general from those who were to be the
defenders of our state ?

Timaeus. It was.

Sokrates. And in assigning on natural principles but one
single pursuit or craft which was suited to each citizen severally,
we declared that those whose duty it was to fight on behalf of
the community must be guardians only of the city, in case any
one whether without or within her walls should seek to injure
her, and that they should give judgment mercifully to their
subjects and natural friends, but show themselves stern to the
enemies they met in battle.

Timaeus. Quite true.

Sokrates. For we described, I think, a certain temperament
which the souls of our guardians must possess, combining in a
peculiar degree high spirit and thoughtfulness, that they might
be able to show a due measure of mildness or sternness to friend
or foe.

Timaeus, Yes.

Sokrates. And what of their training ? were they not to
have been trained in gymnastic and music and all studies which
are connected with these ?

Timaeus. Just so.

Sokrates. And those who had undergone this discipline, we
said, must not consider that they have any private property in
gold or silver or anything else whatsoever, but as auxiliaries
drawing from those whom they preserved so much pay in return
for their protection as was sufficient for temperate men, they
were to spend it in common and pass their lives in company
with one another, devoting themselves perpetually to the pursuit
of virtue and relieved from all other occupations.

Timaeus. That also is the way it was put.

Sokrates. Moreover with regard to women we observed that
their natures must be brought into harmonious similarity with
those of men, and that the same employments must be assigned
to them all both in war and in their general mode of life.

Timaeus. Yes, that was what we said.

Sokrates. And what were our rules concerning the pro-
creation of children ? This, I think, is easy of recollection
because of the novelty of our scheme. We ordained that the
rights of marriage and of children should be common to all, to
the end that no one should ever know his own offspring, but
that each should look upon all as his kindred, regarding as
sisters and brethren all such as were between suitable limits of
age, and those of the former and previous generations as parents
and grandparents, and those after them as children and children's
children.

Timaeus. Yes, it is very easy to remember this too as you
describe it.

Sokrates. Next with a view to securing immediately the
utmost possible perfection in their natures, do we not remember
that it was incumbent on the rulers of both sexes to make
provision for the contraction of marriages by some secret mode
of allotment, that to the good and bad separately might be
allotted mates of their own kind, and so no ill-feeling should
arise among them, supposing as they would that chance governed
the allotment ?

Timaeus. We remember that.

Sokrates. And the offspring of the good we said must be
reared, while that of the bad was to be secretly dispersed among
the other classes of the state ; and continually observing them
as they grew up, the rulers were to restore to their rank such as
were worthy, and in the places of those so promoted substitute
the unworthy in their own rank.

Timaeus. Quite so.

Sokrates. Have we now said enough for a summary re-
capitulation of yesterday's discourse ? or do we feel that any-
thing is lacking, my dear Timaeus, to our account ?

Timaeus. Not at all :- you have exactly described what was
said, Sokrates.

II. Sokrates. Listen then and I will tell you in the next
place what I feel about the constitution which we described.
My feeling is something like this : suppose a man, on beholding
beautiful creatures, whether the work of the painter or really
alive but at rest, should conceive a desire to see them in motion
and putting into active exercise the qualities which seemed to
belong to their form this is just what I feel about our city
which we described : I would fain listen to one who depicted
her engaged in a becoming manner with other countries in those
struggles which cities must undergo, and going to war, and
when at war showing a result worthy of her training and educa-
tion, both when dealing in action and parleying in speech with
other cities. Now, Kritias and Hermokrates, my own verdict
upon myself is that I should never be capable of celebrating the
city and her people according to their merit. So far as concerns
me indeed, that is no marvel ; but I have formed the same
opinion about the poets, both past and present ; not that I
disparage the poetic race, but any one can see that the imitative
tribe will most easily and perfectly imitate the surroundings
amid which they have been brought up, but that which lies
outside the range of each man's experience is hard to imitate
correctly in actions and yet harder in words. As to the class of
sophists on the other hand, I have always held them to be well
furnished with many fine discourses on other subjects ; yet I am
afraid, seeing they wander from city to city and have never had
dwellings of their own to manage, they may somehow fall short
in their conception of philosophers and statesmen, as to what in
time of war and battles they would do and say in their dealings
and converse with divers people. One class then remains, those
who share your habit of mind, having by nature and training a
capacity for both philosophy and statecraft. Timaeus for in-
stance, belonging to an admirably governed state, the Italian
Lokris, and one of the foremost of its citizens in wealth and
birth, has filled offices of the highest authority and honour in
his native city, and has also in my judgment climbed to the
topmost peak of all philosophy : while at Athens we all know
that Kritias is no novice in any of the questions we are discuss-
ing: of Hermokrates too we must believe on the evidence of
many witnesses that his genius and acquirements qualify him to
deal with all such matters. This was in my mind yesterday
when I willingly complied with your request that I should
repeat the conversation concerning the ideal polity ; for I knew
that no men were more competent than you, if you were willing,
to supply the sequel : no one else indeed at the present day
could, after engaging our city in an honourable war, render her
conduct worthy of her in all respects. So after saying all that
was enjoined on me I in my turn enjoined upon you the task of
which I now remind you. Accordingly you consulted together
and agreed to entertain me at this time with a return ' feast of
reason '. I am here then ready for it in festal array, and never
was there a more eager guest.

Hennokrates. Indeed, Sokrates, as Timaeus said, there will
be no lack of zeal on our part, nor can we attempt to excuse
ourselves from performing the task. In fact yesterday imme-
diately on leaving this spot, when we reached the guest-chamber
at the house of Kritias where we are staying, and even before
that on our way thither, we were discussing this very matter.
Kritias then told us a story from an old tradition, which you had
better repeat now, Kritias, to Sokrates, that he may help us to
judge whether it will answer the purpose for our present task or
not.

Kritias. So be it, if our third partner Timaeus agrees.

Timaeus. I quite agree.

Kritias. Listen then, Sokrates, to a tale which, strange
though it be, is yet perfectly true, as Solon, the wisest of the
seven, once affirmed. He was a relation and dear friend of
Dropides, my great-grandfather, as he says himself in man
passages of his poems : and Dropides told my grandfather
Kritias, who when advanced in life repeated it to us, that there
were great and marvellous exploits achieved by Athens in days
of old, which through lapse of time and the perishing of men
have vanished from memory : and the greatest of all is one
which it were fitting for us to narrate, and so at once discharge
our debt of gratitude to you and worthily and truly extol
the goddess in this her festival by a kind of hymn in her
honour.

Sokrates. A good proposal. But what was this deed which
Kritias described on the authority of Solon as actually performed
of old by this city, though unrecorded in history?

III. Kritias. I will tell an ancient story that I heard from
a man no longer young. For Kritias was then, as he said, hard
upon ninety years of age, while I was about ten. It happened
to be the 'children's day' of the Apaturia ; and then as usual
the boys enjoyed their customary pastime, our fathers giving us
prizes for reciting poetry. A great deal of poetry by various
authors was recited, and since that of Solon was new at the
time, many of us children sang his poems. So one of the clans-
men said, whether he really thought so or whether he wished to
please Kritias, he considered that Solon was not only in other
respects the wisest of mankind but also the noblest of all poets
The old man how well I recollect it was extremely pleased
and said smiling, Yes, Amynandros, if he had not treated poetry
merely as a by-work, but had made a serious business of it like
the rest, and if he had finished the legend which he brought
hither from Egypt, instead of being compelled to abandon it by
the factions and other troubles which he found here on his
return, my belief is that neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any
other poet would have enjoyed greater fame than he. What
was the legend, Kritias ? asked Amynandros. It concerned a
mighty achievement, he replied, and one that deserved to be the
most famous in the world ; a deed which our city actually per-
formed, but owing to time and the destruction of the doers
thereof the story has not lasted to our times. Tell us from the
beginning, said the other, what was the tale that Solon told, and
how and from whom he heard it as true.

There is in Egypt, said Kritias, in the Delta, at the apex of
which the stream of the Nile divides, a province called the
Saitic ; and the chief city of this province is Sais, the birthplace
of Amasis the king. The founder of their city is a goddess,
whose name in the Egyptian tongue is Neith, and in Greek, as
they aver, Athena: the people are great lovers of the Athenians
and claim a certain kinship with our countrymen. Now when
Solon travelled to this city he said he was most honourably
entreated by the citizens; moreover when he questioned con-
cerning ancient things such of the priests as were most versed
therein, he found that neither he nor any other Grecian man,
one might wellnigh say, knew aught about such matters. And
once, when he wished to lead them on to talk of ancient times,
he essayed to tell them of the oldest legends of Hellas, of
Phoroneus who was called the first man, and of Niobe; and
again he told the tale of Deukalion and Pyrrha, how they sur-
vived after the deluge, and he reckoned up their descendants, and
tried, by calculating the periods, to count up the number of
years that passed during the events he related. Then said one
of the priests, a man well stricken in years, O Solon, Solon, ye
Greeks are ever children, and old man that is a Grecian is there
none. And when Solon heard it, he said, What meanest thou
by this ? And the priest said, Ye are all young in your souls ;
for ye have not in them because of old tradition any ancient
belief nor knowledge that is hoary with eld. And the reason of
it is this: many and manifold are the destructions of mankind
that have been and shall be; the greatest are by fire and by
water; but besides these there are lesser ones in countless other
fashions. For indeed that tale that is also told among you, how
that Phaethon, the child of the Sun, yoked his father's chariot,
and for that he could not drive in his father's path, he burnt up
all things upon earth and himself was smitten by a thunderbolt
and slain this story, as it is told, has the fashion of a fable;
but the truth of it is a deviation of the bodies that move round
the earth in the heavens, whereby comes at long intervals of
time a destruction with much fire of the things that are upon
earth. Thus do such as dwell on mountains and in high places
and in dry perish more widely than they who live beside rivers
and by the sea. Now the Nile, which is in all else our preserver,
saves us then also from this distress by releasing his founts : but
when the gods send a flood upon the earth, cleansing her with
waters, those in the mountains are saved, the neatherds and
shepherds, but the inhabitants of the cities in your land are
swept by the rivers into the sea. But in this country neither
then nor at any time does water fall from on high upon the
fields, but contrariwise all rises up by nature from below.
Wherefore and for which causes the legends preserved here are
the most ancient that are told : but the truth is that in all places,
where exceeding cold or heat does not forbid, there are ever
human beings, now more, now fewer. Now whether at Athens
or in Egypt, or in any other place whereof we have tidings, any-
thing noble or great or otherwise notable has occurred, we have
all written down and preserved from ancient times in our temple
here. But with you and other nations the commonwealth has
only just been enriched with letters and all else that cities
require : and again after the wonted term of years like a recur-
ring sickness comes rushing on them the torrent from heaven ;
and it leaves only the unlettered and untaught among you, so
that as it were ye become young again with a new birth, know-
ing nought of what happened in the ancient times either in our
country or in yours. For instance the genealogies, Solon, which
yojj just now recounted, concerning the people of your country,
are little better than children's tales. For in the first place ye
remember but one deluge, whereas there had been many before
it ; and moreover ye know not that the fairest and noblest race
among mankind lived once in your country, whence ye sprang
and all your city which now is, from a very little seed that of
old was left over. Ye however know it not, because the sur-
vivors lived and died for many generations without utterance in
writing. For once upon a time, Solon, far back beyond the
greatest destruction by waters, that which is now the city of
the Athenians was foremost both in war and in all besides, and
her laws were exceedingly righteous above all cities. Her deeds
and her government are said to have been the noblest among all
under heaven whereof the report has come to our ears. And
Solon said that on hearing this he was astonished, and used all
urgency in entreating the priests to relate to him from beginning
to end all about those ancient citizens. So the priest said, I
grudge thee not, O Solon, and I will tell it for thy sake and for
the sake of thy city, and chiefly for the honour of the goddess
who was the possessor and nurse and instructress both of your
city and of ours ; for she founded yours earlier by a thousand
years, having taken the seed of you from Earth and Hephaistos;
and ours in later time. And the date of our city's foundation is
recorded in our sacred writings to be eight thousand years ago.
But concerning the citizens of Athens nine thousand years ago I
will inform you in brief of their laws and of the noblest of the
deeds which they performed : the exact truth concerning every-
thing we will examine in due order hereafter, taking the actual
records at our leisure.

Consider now their laws in comparison with those of our
country ; for you will find here at the present day many exam-
ples of the laws which then existed among you : first the
separation of the priestly caste from the rest ; next the distinc-
tion of the craftsmen, that each kind plies its own craft by itself
and mingles not with another ; and the class of shepherds and
of hunters and of husbandmen are set apart ; and that of the
warriors too you have surely noticed is here sundered from all
the other classes ; for on them the law enjoins to study the art
of war and nought else. Furthermore there is the fashion of
their arming with spears and shields, wherewith we have been
the first men in Asia to arm ourselves ; for the goddess taught
this to us, as she did first to you in that country of yours.
Again as regards knowledge, you see how careful our law is in
its. first principles, investigating the laws of nature till it arrives
at divination and medicine, the object of which is health, draw-
ing from these divine studies lessons useful for human needs,
and adding to these all the sciences that are connected there-
withal. With all this constitution and order the goddess estab-
lished you when she founded your nation first; choosing out
the spot in which ye were born because she saw that the mild
temperament of its seasons would produce the highest intelli-
gence in its people. Seeing then that the goddess was a lover
of war and of wisdom, she selected the spot that should bring
forth men likest to herself, and therein she first founded your
race. Thus then did ye dwell governed by such laws as I have
described, ay and even better still, surpassing all men in ex-
cellence, as was meet for them that were offspring and nurslings
of gods.

Many and mighty are the deeds of your city recorded here
for the marvel of men ; but one is there which for greatness and
nobleness surpasses all the rest. For our chronicles tell what a
power your city quelled of old, that marched in wanton inso-
lence upon all Europe and Asia together, issuing yonder from
the Atlantic ocean. For in those days the sea there could be
crossed, since it had an island before the mouth of the strait
which is called, as ye say, the pillars of Herakles. Now this
island was greater than Libya and Asia together ; and there-
from there was passage for the sea-farers of those times to the
other islands, and from the islands to all the opposite continent
which bounds that ocean truly named. For these regions that
lie within the strait aforesaid seem to be but a bay having a
narrow entrance ; but the other is ocean verily, and the land
surrounding it may with fullest truth and fitness be named a
continent. In this island Atlantis arose a great and marvellous
might of kings, ruling over all the island itself, and many other
islands, and parts of the mainland; and besides these, of the
lands east of the strait they governed Libya as far as Egypt, and
Europe to the borders of Etruria. So all this power gathered
itself together, and your country and ours and the whole region
within the strait it sought with one single swoop to enslave.
Then, O Solon, did the power of your city shine forth in all
men's eyes glorious in valour and in strength. For being fore-
most upon earth in courage and the arts of war, sometimes she
was leader of the Hellenes, sometimes she stood alone perforce,
when the rest fell away from her; and after being brought into
the uttermost perils, she vanquished the invaders and triumphed
over them : and the nations that were not yet enslaved she pre-
served from slavery; while the rest of us who dwell this side the
pillars of Herakles, all did she set free with ungrudging hand.
But in later time, after there had been exceeding great earth-
quakes and floods, there fell one day and night of destruction;
and the warriors in your land all in one body were swallowed up
by the earth, and in like manner did the island Atlantis sink
beneath the sea and vanish away. Wherefore to this day the
ocean there is impassable and unsearchable, being blocked by
very shallow shoals, which the island caused as she settled down.
IV. You have heard this brief statement, Sokrates, of what
the ancient Kritias reported that he heard from Solon : and
when you were speaking yesterday about the polity and the
men whom you described, I was amazed as I called to mind the
story I have just told you, remarking how by some miraculous
coincidence most of your account agreed unerringly with the
description of Solon. I was unwilling however to say anything
at the moment, for after so long a time my memory was at
fault. I conceived therefore that I must not speak until I had
thoroughly gone over the whole story by myself. Accordingly
I was quick to accept the task you imposed on us yesterday,
thinking that for the most arduous part of all such undertakings,
I mean supplying a story fitly corresponding to our intentions,
we should be fairly well provided. So then, as Hermokrates
said, as soon as ever I departed hence yesterday, I began to
repeat the legend to our friends as I remembered it; and when
I got home I recovered nearly the whole of it by thinking it
over at night. How true is the saying that what we learn in
childhood has a wonderful hold on the memory. Of what I
heard yesterday I know not if I could call to mind the whole :
but though it is so very long since I heard this tale, I should be
surprised if a single point in it has escaped me. It was with
much boyish delight that I listened at the time, and the
old man was glad to instruct me, (for I asked a great many
questions) ; so that it is indelibly fixed in my mind, like those
encaustic pictures which cannot be effaced. And I narrated the
story to the rest the first thing in the morning, that they might
share my affluence of words. Now therefore, to return to the
object of all our conversation, I am ready to speak, Sokrates,
not only in general terms, but entering into details, as I heard it.
The citizens and the city which you yesterday described to us
as in a fable we will transfer to the sphere of reality and to
our own country, and we will suppose that ancient Athens is
your ideal commonwealth, and say that the citizens whom you
imagined are those veritable forefathers of ours of whom the
priest spoke. They will fit exactly, and there will be nothing
discordant in saying that they were the men who lived in those
days. And dividing the work between us we will all endeavour
to render an appropriate fulfilment of your injunctions. So you
must consider, Sokrates, whether this story of ours satisfies you,
or whether we must look for another in its stead.

Sokrates, How could we change it for the better, Kritias ?
It is specially appropriate to this festival of the goddess, owing
to its connexion with her ; while the fact that it is no fictitious
tale but a true history is surely a great point. How shall we
find other such citizens if we relinquish these ? It cannot be :
so with Fortune's favour do you speak on, while I in requital for
my discourse of yesterday have in my turn the privilege of
listening in silence.

Kritias. Now consider, Sokrates, how we proposed to dis-
tribute your entertainment. We resolved that Timaeus, who is
the best astronomer among us, and who has most of all made it
his business to understand universal nature, should speak first,
beginning with the origin of the universe, and should end with
the birth of mankind : and that I should follow, receiving from
him mankind brought to being in theory, and from you a por-
tion of them exceptionally cultivated ; and that in accordance
with Solon's laws, no less than with his statement, I should
introduce them before our tribunal and make them our fellow-
citizens, as being the Athenians of bygone days, whom the
declaration of the sacred writings has delivered from their
oblivion ; and thenceforward we shall speak as if their claim to
Athenian citizenship were fairly established.

Sokrates. Ample and splendid indeed, it seems, will be the
banquet of discourse which I am to receive in my turn. So it
would seem to be your business to speak next, Timaeus, after
you have duly invoked the gods.

V. Timaeus. Yes indeed, Sokrates, that is what all do who
possess the slightest share of judgment ; at the outset of every
work, great or small, they always call upon a god : and seeing
that we are going to enter on a discussion of the universe, how
far it is created or perchance uncreate, unless we are altogether
beside ourselves, we must needs invoke the gods and goddesses
and pray above all that our discourse may be pleasing in their
sight, next that it may be consistent with itself. Let it suffice
then thus to have called upon the gods ; but we must call upon
ourselves likewise to conduct the discourse in such a way that
you will most readily comprehend me, and I shall most fully carry
out my intentions in expounding the subject that is before us.

First then in my judgment this distinction must be made.
What is that which is eternally and has no becoming, and again
what is that which comes to be but is never ? The one is com-
prehensible by thought with the aid of reason, ever changeless ;
the other opinable by opinion with the aid of reasonless sensa-
tion, becoming and perishing, never truly existent. Now all
that comes to be must needs be brought into being by some
cause : for it is impossible for anything without a cause to
attain to birth. Of whatsoever thing then the Artificer, looking
ever to the changeless and using that as his model, works out
the design and function, all that is so accomplished must needs
be fair : but if he look to that which has come to be, using the
created as his model, the work is not fair. Now as to the whole
heaven or order of the universe for whatsoever name is most
acceptable to it, be it so named by us we must first ask con-
cerning it the question which lies at the outset of every inquiry,
whether did it exist eternally, having no beginning of generation,
or has it come into being, starting from some beginning? It
has come into being : for it can be seen and felt and has body ;
and all such things are sensible, and sensible things, apprehen-
sible by opinion with sensation, belong, as we saw, to becoming
and creation. We say that what has come to be must be
brought into being by some cause. Now the maker and father
of this All it were a hard task to find, and having found him, it
were impossible to declare him to all men. However we must
again inquire concerning him, after which of the models did the
framer of it fashion the universe, after the changeless and abid-
ing, or after that which has come into being? If now this
universe is fair and its Artificer good, it is plain that he looked
to the eternal ; but if nay it may not even be uttered without
impiety, then it was to that which has come into being. Now
it is manifest to every one that he looked to the eternal : for the
universe is fairest of all things that have come to be, and he is
the most excellent of causes. And having come on this wise
into being it has been created in the image of that which is
comprehensible by reason and wisdom and changes never.
Granting this, it must needs be that this universe is a likeness of
something. Now it is all-important to make our beginning
according to nature: and this affirmation must be laid down
with regard to a likeness and its model, that the words must be
akin to the subjects of which they are the interpreters : there-
fore of that which is abiding and sure and discoverable by the
aid of reason the words too must be abiding and unchanging,
and so far as it lies in words to be incontrovertible and immova-
ble, they must in no wise fall short of this ; but those which deal
with that which is made in the image of the former and which is
a likeness must be likely and duly corresponding with their
subject : as being is to becoming, so is truth to belief. If then,
Sokrates, after so many men have said divers things concerning
the gods and the generation of the universe, we should not prove
able to render an account everywhere and in all respects con-
sistent and accurate, let no one be surprised ; but if we can
produce one as probable as any other, we must be content,
remembering that I who speak and you my judges are but men :
so that on these subjects we should be satisfied with the probable
story and seek nothing further.

Sokrates. Quite right, Timaeus ; we must accept it exactly
as you say. Your prelude is exceedingly welcome to us, so
please proceed with the strain itself.

VI. Timaeus. Let us declare then for what cause nature
and this All was framed by him that framed it. He was good,
and in none that is good can there arise jealousy of aught at
any time. So being far aloof from this, he desired that all things
should be as like unto himself as possible. This is that most
sovereign cause of nature and the universe which we shall most
surely be right in accepting from men of understanding. For
God desiring that all things should be good, and that, so far as
this might be, there should be nought evil, having received all
that is visible not in a state of rest, but moving without harmony
or measure, brought it from its disorder into order, thinking that
this was in all ways better than the other. Now it neither has
been nor is permitted to the most perfect to do aught but what
is most fair. Therefore he took thought and perceived that of
all things which are by nature visible, no work that is without
reason will ever be fairer than that which has reason, setting
whole against whole, and that without soul reason cannot dwell
in anything. Because then he argued thus, in forming the
universe he created reason in soul and soul in body, that he
might be the maker of a work that was by nature most fair and
perfect. In this way then we ought to affirm according to the
probable account that this universe is a living creature in very
truth possessing soul and reason by the providence of God.

Having attained thus far, we must go on to tell what follows :
after the similitude of what animal its framer fashioned it. To
none of these which naturally belong to the class of the partial
must we deign to liken it : for nothing that is like to the im-
perfect could ever become fair ; but that of which the other
animals severally and in their kinds are portions, to this above
all things we must declare that the universe is most like. For
that comprehends and contains in itself all ideal animals, even as
this universe contains us and all other creatures that have been
formed to be visible. For since God desired to liken it most
nearly to what is fairest of the objects of reason and in all respects
perfect, he made it a single visible living being, containing within
itself all animals that are by nature akin to it. Are we right
then in affirming the universe to be one, or had it been more true
to speak of a great and boundless number ? One it must be, if
it is to be created according to its pattern. For that which
comprehends all ideal animals that are could never be a second
in company of another: for there must again exist another
animal comprehending them, whereof the two would be parts,
and no longer to them but to that which comprehended them
should we more truly affirm the universe to have been likened.
To the end then that in its solitude this universe might be like
the all-perfect animal, the maker made neither two universes nor
an infinite number ; but as it has come into being, this universe
one and only-begotten, so it is and shall be for ever.

VII. Now that which came into being must be material and
such as can be seen and touched. Apart from fire nothing
could ever become visible, nor without something solid could it
be tangible, and solid cannot exist without earth : therefore did
God when he set about to frame the body of the universe form
it of fire and of earth. But it is not possible for two things
to be fairly united without a third; for they need a bond between
them which shall join them both. The best of bonds is that
which makes itself and those which it binds as complete a unity
as possible ; and the nature of proportion is to accomplish this
most perfectly. For when of any three numbers, whether ex-
pressing three or two dimensions, one is a mean term, so that as
the first is to the middle, so is the middle to the last ; and con-
versely as the last is to the middle, so is the middle to the first ; then
since the middle becomes first and last, and the last and the first
both become middle, of necessity all will come to be the same, and
being the same with one another all will be a unity. Now if the
body of the universe were to have been made a plane surface
having no thickness, one mean would have sufficed to unify itself
and the extremes ; but now since it behoved it to be solid,
and since solids can never be united by one mean, but require two
God accordingly set air and water betwixt fire and earth, and
making them as far as possible exactly proportional, so that fire
is to air as air to water, and as air is to water water is to earth,
thus he compacted and constructed a universe visible and tangible.
For these reasons and out of elements of this kind, four in
number, the body of the universe was created, being brought
into concord through proportion ; and from these it derived
friendship, so that coming to unity with itself it became in-
dissoluble by any force save the will of him who joined it.

Now the making of the universe took up the whole bulk of
each of these four elements. Of all fire and all water and air
and earth its framer fashioned it, leaving over no part nor power
without. Therein he had this intent : first that it might be
a creature perfect to the utmost with all its parts perfect; next
that it might be one, seeing that nothing was left over whereof
another should be formed ; furthermore that it might be free
from age and sickness ; for he reflected that when hot things
and cold and all such as have strong powers gather round a
composite body from without and fall unseasonably upon it,
they undermine it, and bringing upon it sickness and age cause
its decay. For such motives and reasons he fashioned it as one
whole, with each of its parts whole in itself, so as to be perfect
and free from age and sickness. And he assigned to it its
proper and natural shape. To that which is to comprehend all
animals in itself that shape seems proper which comprehends in
itself all shapes that are. Wherefore he turned it of a rounded
and spherical shape, having its bounding surface in all points at
an equal distance from the centre : this being the most perfect
and regular shape ; for he thought that a regular shape was
infinitely fairer than an irregular. And all round about he
finished off the outer surface perfectly smooth, for many
reasons. It needed not eyes, for naught visible was left
outside; nor hearing, for there was nothing to hear; and there
was no surrounding air which made breathing needful. Nor
must it have any organ whereby it should receive into itself its
sustenance, and again reject that which was already digested ;
for nothing went forth of it nor entered in from anywhere ; for
there was nothing. For by design was it created to supply its
own sustenance by its own wasting, and to have all its action
and passion in itself and by itself : for its framer deemed that
were it self-sufficing it would be far better than if it required
aught else. And hands, wherewith it had no need to grasp
aught nor to defend itself against another, he thought not fit idly
to bestow upon it, nor yet feet, nor in a word anything to serve
as the means of movement. For he assigned it that motion
which was proper to its bodily form, of all the seven that which
most belongs to reason and intelligence. Wherefore turning it
about uniformly in the same spot on its own axis, he made it to
revolve round and round ; but all the six motions he took away
from it and left it without part in their wanderings. And since
for this revolution there was no need of feet he made it without
legs and without feet.

VIII. So the universal design of the ever-living God, that
he planned for the God that was some time to be, made its
surface smooth and even, everywhere equally distant from the
centre, a body whole and perfect out of perfect bodies. And
God set soul in the midst thereof and spread her through all its
body and even wrapped the body about with her from without,
and he made it a sphere in a circle revolving, a universe one and
alone ; but for its excellence it was able to be company to itself
and needed no other, being sufficient for itself as acquaintance
and friend. For all these things then he created it a happy god.
But the soul was not made by God younger than the body,
even as she comes later in this account we are essaying to give ;
for he would not when he had joined them together have suffered
the elder to be governed by the younger : but we are far too
prone to a casual and random habit of mind which shows itself
in our speech. God made soul in birth and in excellence
earlier and elder than body, to be its mistress and governor ; and
he framed her out of the following elements and in the following
way. From the undivided and ever changeless substance and
that which becomes divided in material bodies, of both these he
mingled in the third place the form of Essence, in the midst
between the Same and the Other; and this he composed on such
wise between the undivided and that which is in material bodies
divided ; and taking them, three in number, he blended them
into one form, forcing the nature of the Other, hard as it was to
mingle, into union with the Same. And mingling them with
Essence and of the three making one, again he divided this into
as many parts as was meet, each part mingled of Same and
of Other and of Essence. And he began his dividing thus : first
he took one portion from the whole ; then he went on to take a
portion double of this ; and the third half as much again as the
second and triple of the first; the fourth double of the second ;
the fifth three times the third ; the sixth eight times the first,
the seventh twenty-seven times the first. After that, he filled up
the interval between the powers of two and of three by severing
yet more from the original mass and placing it between them in
such a manner that within each interval were two means, the
first exceeding one extreme in the same proportion as it was
exceeded by the other, the second by the same number exceed-
ing the one as it was exceeded by the other. And whereas by
these links there were formed in the original intervals new
intervals of f and f and , he went on to fill up all the intervals
of f with that of f, leaving in each a fraction over ; and the
terms of the interval forming this fraction are in the numerical
proportion of 2$6 to 243. By this time the mixture, whence he
cut off these portions, was all used up. Next he cleft the
structure so formed lengthwise into two halves, and laying the
two so as to meet in the centre in the shape of the letter X, he
bent them into a circle and joined them, causing them to meet
themselves and each other at a point opposite to that of their
original contact : and he comprehended them in the motion that
revolves uniformly on the same axis, and one of the circles he
made exterior and one interior. The exterior motion he named
the motion of the Same, the interior that of the Other. And
the circle of the Same he made revolve to the right by way of
the side, that of the Other to the left by way of the diagonal.
And he gave the supremacy to the motion of the same and
uniform, for he left that single and undivided ; but the inner
circle he cleft into seven unequal circles in the proportion of the
double and triple intervals severally, each being three in number;
and he appointed that the circles should move in opposite
directions, three at the same speed, the other four differing
in speed from the three and among themselves, yet moving in a
due ratio.

IX. Now after that the framing of the soul was finished to
the mind of him that framed her, next he fashioned within her
all that is bodily, and he drew them together and fitted them
middle to middle. And from the midst even unto the ends
of heaven she was woven in everywhere and encompassed it
around from without, and having her movement in herself
she began a divine beginning of endless and reasonable life for
ever and evermore. Now the body of the universe has been
created visible ; but she is invisible, and she, even soul, has part
in reason and in harmony. And whereas she is made by the
best of all whereunto belong reason and eternal being, so she is
the best of all that is brought into being. Therefore since she is
formed of the nature of Same and of Other and of Being, of these
three portions blended, in due proportion divided and bound
together, and turns about and returns into herself, whenever she
touches aught that has manifold existence or aught that has
undivided, she is stirred through all her substance, and she tells
that wherewith the thing is same and that wherefrom it is
different, and in what relation or place or manner or time
it comes to pass both in the region of the changing and in the
region of the changeless that each thing affects another and
is affected. This word of hers is true alike, whether it deal with
Same or with Other, without voice or sound in the Self-moved
arising ; and when she is busied with the sensible, and the circle
of the Other, being true, announces it throughout all the soul,
then are formed sure opinions and true beliefs ; and when she is
busy with the rational, and the circle of the Same declares
it, running smoothly, then reason and knowledge cannot but be
made perfect. And in whatsoever existing thing these two are
found, if a man affirm it is aught but soul, what he says will be
anything rather than the truth.

X. And when the father who begat it perceived the created
image of the eternal gods, that it had motion and life, he re-
joiced and was well pleased ; and he bethought him to make it
yet more nearly like its pattern. Now whereas that is a living
being eternally existent, even so he essayed to make this All the
like to the best of his power. Now so it was that the nature of
the ideal was eternal. But to bestow this attribute altogether
upon a created thing was impossible ; so he bethought him to
make a moving image of eternity, and while he was ordering
the universe he made of eternity that abides in unity an eternal
image moving according to number, even that which we have
named time. For whereas days and nights and months and
years were not before the universe was created, he then devised
the generation of them along with the fashioning of the universe.
Now all these are portions of time, and was and shall be are
forms of time that have come to be, although we wrongly
ascribe them unawares to the eternal essence. For we say that
it was and is and shall be, but in verity is alone belongs to it :
and was and shall be it is meet should be applied only to
Becoming which moves in time ; for these are motions. But
that which is ever changeless without motion must not become
elder or younger in time, neither must it have become so in the
past nor be so in the future ; nor has it to do with any attributes
that Becoming attaches to the moving objects of sense : these
have come into being as forms of time, which is the image of
eternity and revolves according to number. Moreover we say
that the become is the become, and the becoming is the be-
coming, and that which shall become is that which shall become,
and not-being is not-being. In all this we speak incorrectly.
But concerning these things the present were perchance not the
right season to inquire particularly.

XI. Time then has come into being along with the universe,
that being generated together, together they may be dissolved,
should a dissolution of them ever come to pass ; and it was
made after the pattern of the eternal nature, that it might be as
like to it as was possible. For the pattern is existent for all
eternity ; but the copy has been and is and shall be throughout
all time continually. So then this was the plan and intent of
God for the generation of time ; the sun and the moon and five
other stars which have the name of planets have been created
for defining and preserving the numbers of time. And when
God had made their several bodies, he set them in the orbits
wherein the revolution of the Other was moving, in seven circles
seven stars. The moon he placed in that nearest the earth, and
in the second above the earth he set the sun ; and the morning-
star and that which is held sacred to Hermes he assigned to
those that moved in an orbit having equal speed with the sun,
but having a contrary tendency : wherefore the sun and Hermes
and the morning star in like manner overtake and are over-
taken one by another. And as to the rest, were we to set forth
all the orbits wherein he put them and the causes wherefore he
did so, the account, though only by the way, would lay on us a
heavier task than that which was our chief object in giving it.
These things perhaps may hereafter, when we have leisure, find
a fitting exposition.

But when each of the beings which were to join in creating
time had arrived in its proper orbit, and had been generated as
animate creatures, their bodies secured with living bonds, and
had learnt their appointed task ; then in the motion of the
Other, which was slanting and crossed the motion of the Same
and was thereby controlled, whereas one of these planets had a
larger, another a smaller circuit, the lesser orbit was completed
more swiftly, the larger more slowly : but because of the motion
of the Same those which revolved most swiftly seemed to be
overtaken by those that went more slowly, though really they
overtook them. For the motion of the Same, twisting all their
circles into spirals, because they have a separate and simul-
taneous motion in the opposite way, being of all the swiftest
displays closest to itself that which departs most slowly from
it. And that there might be some clear measure of the relative
swiftness and slowness with which they moved in their eight
revolutions, God kindled a light in the second orbit from the
earth, which we now have named the sun, in order that it might
shine most brightly to the ends of heaven, and that living
things, so many as was meet, should possess number, learning it
from the motion of the same and uniform. Night then and day
have been created in this manner and for these causes ; and
this is one revolution of the undivided and most intelligent
circuit ; and a month is fulfilled when the moon, after com-
pleting her own orbit, overtakes the sun ; a year, when the sun
has completed his own course. But the courses of the others
men have not taken into account, save a few out of many ; and
they neither give them names nor measure them against one
another, comparing them by means of numbers nay I may
say they do not know that time arises from the wanderings of
these, which are incalculable in multitude and marvellously
intricate. None the less however can we observe that the
perfect number of time fulfils the perfect year at the moment
when the relative swiftnesses of all the eight revolutions ac-
complish their course together and reach their starting-point,
being measured by-the circle of the same and uniformly moving.
In this way then and for these causes were created all such of
the stars as wander through the heavens and turn about therein,
in order that this universe may be most like to the perfect and
ideal animal by its assimilation to the eternal being.

XII. Now up to the generation of time all else had been
accomplished in the likeness of that whereunto it was likened :
but in that it did not yet contain all living creatures created
within it, herein it was still unlike. So he went on to complete
this that remained unfinished, moulding it after the nature of the
pattern. So many forms then as Mind perceived to exist in the
ideal animal, according to their variety and multitude, such
kinds and such a number did he think fit that this universe
should possess. These are fourfold : first the race of the
heavenly gods, next the winged tribe whose path is in the air,
third whatso dwells in the water, and fourth that which goes
upon dry land. The visible form of the deities he created
chiefly of fire, that it might be most radiant and most fair to
behold ; and likening it to the All he shaped it like a sphere
and assigned it to the intelligence of the supreme to follow after
it ; and he disposed it throughout all the firmament of heaven,
to be an adornment of it in very truth, wrought cunningly over
the whole expanse. And he bestowed two movements upon
each, one in the same spot and uniform, whereby it should be
ever constant to its own thoughts concerning the same thing;
the other forward, but controlled by the revolution of the same
and uniform : but for the other five movements he made it
motionless and still, that each star might attain the highest
completeness of perfection. From which cause have been
created all the stars that wander not but abide fast for ever,
living beings divine and eternal and in one spot revolving :
while those that move in a circle and wander as aforesaid have
come into being on those principles which in the foregoing we
have declared.

And the earth our foster-mother, that is globed round the
axis stretched from pole to pole of the universe, her he fashioned
to be the guardian and creator of night and day, the first and
most august of the gods that have been created within the
heavens. But the circlings of them and their crossings one of
another, and the manner of the returning of their orbits upon
themselves and their approximations, and which of the deities
meet in their conjunctions and which are in opposition, and how
they pass before and behind each other, and at what times they
are hidden from us and again reappearing send to them who
cannot calculate their motions panics and portents of things to
come to declare all this without visible illustrations of their
very movements were labour lost. So let thus much suffice on
this head and let our exposition concerning the nature of the
gods visible and created be brought to an end.

XIII. But concerning the other divinities, to declare and
determine their generation were a task too mighty for us :
therefore we must trust in those who have revealed it here-
tofore, seeing that they are offspring, as they said, of gods, and
without doubt know their own forefathers. We cannot then
mistrust the children of gods, though they speak without pro-
bable or inevitable demonstrations ; but since they profess to
announce what pertains to their own kindred, we must conform
to usage and believe them. Let us then accept on their word
this account of the generation of these gods. Of Earth and
Heaven were born children, Okeanos and Tethys ; of these
Phorkys and Kronos and Rhea and all their brethren : and of
Kronos and Rhea, Zeus and Hera and all whom we know to be
called their brothers ; and they in their turn had children after
them.

Now when all the gods had come to birth, both those who
revolve before our eyes and those who reveal themselves in so far
as they will, he who begat this universe spake to them these words:
Gods of gods, whose creator am I and father of works, which
by me coming into being are indissoluble save by my will :
Behold, all which hath been fastened may be loosed, yet to
loose that which is well fitted and in good case were the will of
an evil one. Wherefore, forasmuch as ye have come into being,
immortal ye are not, nor indissoluble altogether ; nevertheless
shall ye not be loosed nor meet with the doom of death, having
found in my will a bond yet mightier and more sovereign than
those that ye were bound withal when ye came into being.
Now therefore hearken to the word that I declare unto you.
Three kinds of mortal beings are yet uncreate. And if these
be not created, the heaven will be imperfect; for it will not
have within it all kinds of living things; yet these it must have,
if it is to be perfect. But if these were created by my hands
and from me received their life, they would be equal to gods.

Therefore in order that they may be mortal, and that this All
may be truly all, turn ye according to nature unto the creation
of living things, imitating my power that was put forth in the
generation of you. Now such part of them as is worthy to
share the name of the immortals, which is called divine and
governs in the souls of those that are willing ever to follow
after justice and after you, this I, having sown and provided it,
will deliver unto you : and ye for the rest, weaving the mortal
with the immortal, shall create living beings and bring them to
birth, and giving them sustenance shall ye increase them, and
when they perish receive them back again.

XIV. Thus spake he ; and again into the same bowl wherein
he mingled and blended the universal soul he poured what was
left of the former, mingling it somewhat after the same manner,
yet no longer so pure as before but second and third in pure-
ness. And when he had compounded the whole, he portioned
off souls equal in number to the stars and distributed a soul to
each star, and setting them in the stars as though in a chariot,
he shewed them the nature of the universe and declared to
them its fated laws; how that the first incarnation should be
ordained to be the same for all, that none might suffer dis-
advantage at his hands ; and how they must be sown into the
instruments of time, each into that which was meet for it, and
be born as the most god-fearing of all living creatures ; and
whereas human nature was twofold, the stronger was that race
which should hereafter be called man. When therefore they
should be of necessity implanted in bodily forms, and of their
bodies something should ever be coming in and other passing
away, in the first place they must needs all have innate one and
the same faculty of sense, arising from forcible affections ; next
love mingled with pleasure and pain ; and besides these fear
and wrath and all the feelings that accompany these and such
as are of a contrary nature : and should they master these
passions, they would live in righteousness ; if otherwise, in un-
righteousness. And he who lived well throughout his allotted
time should be conveyed once more to a habitation in his
kindred star, and there should enjoy a blissful and congenial
life: but failing of this, he should pass in the second incar-
nation into the nature of a woman ; and if in this condition he
still would not turn from the evil of his ways, then, according
to the manner of his wickedness, he should ever be changed
into the nature of some beast in such form of incarnation as
fitted his disposition, and should not rest from the weariness of
these transformations, until by following the revolution that is
within him of the same and uniform, he should overcome by
reason all that burden that afterwards clung around him of fire
and water and air and earth, a troublous and senseless mass,
and should return once more to the form of his first and best
nature.

And when he had ordained all these things for them, to the
end that he might be guiltless of all the evil that should be in
each of them, God sowed some in the earth, some in the moon,
and some in the other instruments of time. And what came
after the sowing he gave into the hands of the young gods, to
mould mortal bodies, and having wrought all the residue of
human soul that needed yet to be added, to govern and guide
as nobly and perfectly as they could the mortal creature, in so
far as it brought not evil upon its own head.

XV. So when he had made all these ordinances for them
God was abiding after the manner of his own nature : and as he
so abode, the children thinking on the command of their father
were obedient to it, and having received the immortal principle
of a mortal creature, imitating their own artificer, they bor-
rowed from the universe portions of fire and of earth and of
water and of air, on condition that they should be returned
again, and they cemented together what they took, not with the
indissoluble bonds wherewithal they themselves were held to-
gether, but welding it with many rivets, invisible for smallness,
and making of all the elements one body for each creature, they
confined the revolutions of the immortal soul in a body in-
flowing and out-flowing continually. And they, being confined
in a great river, neither controlled it nor were controlled, but
bore and were borne violently to and fro ; so that the whole
creature moved, but advanced at random without order or
method, having all the six motions : for they moved forward
and backward and again to right and to left and downward and
upward, and in every way went straying in the six directions.
For great as was the tide sweeping over them and flowing off
which brought them sustenance, a yet greater tumult was caused
by the effects of the bodies that struck against them ; as when
the body of any one came in contact with some alien fire that
met it from without, or with solid earth, or with liquid glidings
of water, or if he were caught in a tempest of winds borne on
the air, and so the motions from all these elements rushing
through the body penetrated to the soul. This is in fact the
reason why these have all alike been called and still are called
sensations (atcr^o-et?). Then too did they produce the most
wide and vehement agitation for the time being, joining with the
perpetually streaming current in stirring and violently shaking
the revolutions of the soul, so that they altogether hindered the
circle of the Same by flowing contrary to it, and they stopped
it from governing and from going ; while the circle of the Other
they displaced, so that the double and triple intervals, being
three of each sort, and the means and junctures of f and f and ,
since they could not be utterly undone save by him that joined
them, were forced by them to turn in all kinds of ways and to
admit all manner of breaking and twisting of the circles, in
every possible form, so that they can barely hold to one another,
and though they are in motion, it is motion without law, some-
times reversed, now slanting, and now inverted. It is as though
a man should stand on his head, resting it on the earth and
supporting his feet against something aloft ; in this case the man
in such condition and the spectators would reciprocally see right
and left reversed in the persons of each other. The same and
similar effects are produced with great intensity in the soul's
revolutions : and when from external objects there meets them
anything that belongs to the class of the Same or to that of the
Other, then they declare its relative sameness or difference quite
contrariwise to the truth, and show themselves false and irra-
tional ; and no circuit is governor or leader in them at that
time. And whenever sensations from without rushing up and fall-
ing upon them drag along with them the whole vessel of the soul,
then the circuits seem to govern though they really are governed.
On account then of all these experiences the soul is at first
bereft of reason, now as in the beginning, when she is confined in
a mortal body. But when the stream of growth and nutriment
flows in with smaller volume, and the revolutions calming down
go their own way and become settled as time passes on, then
the orbits are reduced to the form that belongs to the several
circles in their natural motion, and declaring accurately the
Other and the Same, they set their possessor in the way to
become rational. And if any just discipline of education help
this process, he becomes whole altogether without a blemish,
having made his escape from the most grievous of plagues ; but
if he neglect it, he passes the days of his life halt and maimed,
and unhallowed and unreasonable he comes again to Hades.
These things however belong to a later time : we must discuss
more exactly the subject immediately before us. And as to
the matters which are previous to this, concerning the genera-
tion of the body in all its parts and concerning soul, and the
reasons and designs of the gods whereby they have come into
being, we must cling to the most probable theory, and by pro-
ceeding in this way so give an account of all.

XVI. Imitating the shape of the universe, which was sphe-
rical, they confined the two divine revolutions in a globe-shaped
body, the same that we now call the head, which is the divinest
part of us and has dominion over all our members. To this the
gods gave the whole body, when they had put it together, to
minister to it, reflecting that it possessed all the motions that
should be. In order then that it might not have to roll upon
the earth, which has hills and hollows of all kinds, nor be at
a loss to surmount the one and climb out of the other, they gave
it the body for a conveyance and for ease of going : whence the
body was endowed with length and grew four limbs that could
be stretched and bent, which the god devised for it to go withal,
and by means of which clinging and supporting itself it is
enabled to pass through every place, bearing at the top of us
the habitation of the most divine and sacred element. In this
way then and for these reasons were legs and hands added to
all mankind ; and the gods, deeming that the front was more
honourable than the back and more fit to lead, made us to move
for the most part in this direction. So it behoved man to have
the front part distinguished and unlike the back. Therefore
having set the face upon the globe of the head on that side, they
attached to it organs for all the forethought of the soul, and
they ordained that this which had the faculty of guidance should
be by nature the front. And first of the organs they wrought light-
giving eyes, which they fixed there on the plan I shall explain.
Such sort of fire as had the property of yielding a gentle light
but not of burning, they contrived to form into a substance akin
to the light of every day. The fire within us, which is akin to
the daylight, they made to flow pure smooth and dense through
the eyes, having made close the whole fabric of the eyes and
especially the pupils, so that they kept back all that was coarser
and suffered only this to filter through unmixed and pure.
Whenever then there is daylight surrounding the current of
vision, then this issues forth as like into like, and coalescing with
the light is formed into one uniform substance in the direct line
of vision, wherever the stream issuing from within strikes upon
some external object that falls in its way. So the whole from
its uniformity becomes sympathetic ; and whenever it comes in
contact with anything else, or anything with it, it passes on the
motions thereof over the whole body until they reach the soul,
and thus causes that sensation which we call seeing. But when
its kindred fire departs into night, the visual current is cut off:
for issuing into an alien element it is itself changed and quenched,
having no longer a common nature with the surrounding air,
which has in it no fire. Therefore it ceases from seeing and
moreover becomes an allurement to sleep. For the gods had
devised as a safeguard of the sight the structure of the eyelids ;
and when these are closed, they shut up the force of fire within ;
and this smoothes and calms the motions within ; and when
these are calmed, quiet ensues. And if the quiet is profound,
sleep with few dreams falls on us ; but if some of the stronger
motions are left, according to their nature and the places where
they remain, they engender visions corresponding in kind and in
number; which are images within us, and when we awake are
remembered as outside us. Now the explanation of reflections
in mirrors and all bright smooth surfaces is no longer hard to
discern. For because of the communion of the internal and
external fire, which again is united on the smooth surface and in
manifold ways deflected, all these reflections take place ; the fire
that belongs to the face coalescing with the fire of the visual
current upon the surface of the smooth bright object. And left
appears right and right left, because mutually opposite particles
of the visual current and of the object seen come into contact,
contrary to the wonted mode of collision. On the other hand right
appears as right and left as left, when in the act of combination
with that wherewith it combines the ray changes sides. This
happens when the smooth surface of the mirror is curved up-
wards on each side and so throws the right portion of the visual
current to the left side and the ccfoiverse. But if it is turned
lengthwise to the face, it makes this same reflection appear
completely upside down, thrusting the lower portion of the ray
to the upper end and the upper to the lower.

All these things are among the secondary causes which God
uses to serve him in carrying out the idea of the best so far
as is possible. But the multitude regard them not as secondary
but as primary causes, which act by cooling and heating, con-
densing and rarefying, and all such processes. Yet they are
incapable of all reason or thought for any purpose. For the
only existing thing to which belongs the possession of reason
we must affirm to be soul : and this is invisible, whereas fire
and water and air and earth are all visible creations. Now
the lover of reason and knowledge must first seek for the
causes which belong to the rational order ; and only in the
second place those which belong to the class of things which
are moved by others and move others in turn. This then is
what we must also do : we must declare both classes of causes,
distinguishing between those which with the aid of reason are
the creators of fair things and good, and those which being
destitute of reason produce from time to time chance effects
without design. Enough then of the auxiliary causes which
combine in giving the eyes the power they now possess ; but
the great result, for the sake of which God bestowed them on
us, must be our next theme. Sight, according to my judgment,
has been the cause of the greatest blessing to us, inasmuch
as of our present discourse concerning the universe not one
word would have been uttered had we never seen the stars and
the sun and the heavens. But now day and night, being seen
of us, and months and the revolution of the years have created
number, and they gave us the notion of time and the power of
searching into the nature of the All ; whence we have derived
philosophy, than which no greater good has come neither shall
come hereafter as the gift of heaven to mortal man. This I
declare to be the chiefest blessing due to the eyes : on the rest
that are meaner why should we descant ? let him who loves not
wisdom, if he be blinded of these, lament with idle moan. But
on our part let this be affirmed to be the cause of vision, for
these ends : God discovered and bestowed sight upon us in
order that we might observe the orbits of reason which are
in heaven and make use of them for the revolutions of thought
in our own souls, which are akin to them, the troubled to the
serene; and that learning them and acquiring natural truth
of reasoning we might imitate the divine movements that are
ever unerring and bring into order those within us which are
all astray. And of sound and hearing again the same account
must be given : to the same ends and with the same intent
they have been bestowed on us by the gods. For not only
has speech been appointed for this same purpose, whereto it
contributes the largest share, but all such music as is expressed
in sound has been granted, for the sake of harmony : and
harmony, having her motions akin to the revolutions in our
own souls, has been bestowed by the Muses on him who with
reason seeks their help, not for any senseless pleasure, such
as is now supposed to be its chiefest use, but as an ally against
the discord which has grown up in the revolution of our soul,
to bring her into order and into unison with herself: and
rhythm too, because our habit of mind is mostly so faulty
of measure and lacking in grace, is a succour bestowed on us
by the same givers for the same ends.

XVII. Now in our foregoing discourse, with few exceptions,
we have been declaring the creations wrought through mind :
we must now set by their side those things which come into
being through necessity. For the generation of this universe
was a mixed creation by a combination of necessity and reason.
And whereas reason governed necessity, by persuading her
to guide the greatest part of created things to the best end,
on such conditions and principles, through necessity overcome
by reasonable persuasion, this universe was fashioned in the
beginning. If then we would really declare its creation in
the manner whereby it has come to be, we must add also the
nature of the Errant Cause, and its moving power. Thus then
let us return upon our steps, and when we have found a second
fitting cause for the things aforesaid, let us once more, pro-
ceeding in the present case as we did in the former, begin over
again from the beginning. Now we must examine what came
before the creation of the heavens, the very origin of fire and
water and air and earth, and the conditions that were before
them. For now no one has declared the manner of their
generation ; but we speak as if men knew what is fire and
each of the others, and we treat them as beginnings, as elements
of the whole ; whereas by one who has ever so little intelligence
they could not plausibly be represented as belonging even to
the class of syllables. Now however let our say thus be said.
The first principle or principles or whatever we may hold it
to be which underlies all things we must not declare at present,
for no other reason but that it is difficult according to the
present method of our exposition to make clear our opinion.
You must not then deem that I ought to discourse of this,
nor could I persuade myself that I should be right in essaying
so mighty a task. But holding fast the principle we laid down
at the outset, the value of a probable account, I will strive to
give an explanation that is no less probable than another, but
more so ; returning back to describe from the beginning each
and all things. So now again at the outset of our quest let
us call upon God to pilot us safe through a strange and un-
familiar discourse to the haven of probability ; and thus let
us begin once more.

XVIII. Our new exposition of the universe then must be
founded on a fuller classification than the former. Then we
distinguished two forms, but now a third kind must be disclosed.
The two were indeed enough for our former discussion, when
we laid down one form as the pattern, intelligible and change-
less, the second as a copy of the pattern, which comes into
being and is visible. A third we did not then distinguish,
deeming that the two would suffice : but now, it seems, by
constraint of our discourse we must try to express and make
manifest a form obscure and dim. What power then must we
conceive that nature has given it ? something like this. It is
the receptacle, and as it were the nurse, of all becoming. This
saying is true, but we must put it in clearer language : and this
is hard ; especially as for the sake of it we must needs inquire
into fire and the substances that rank with fire. For it is hard
to say which of all these we ought to call water any more than
fire, or indeed which we ought to call by any given name,
rather than all and each severally, in such a way as to employ
any truthful and trustworthy mode of speech. How then are we
to deal with this point, and what is the question that we should
properly raise concerning it ? In the first place, what we now have
named water, by condensation, as we suppose, we see turning
to stones and earth ; and by rarefying and expanding this same
element becomes wind and air ; and air when inflamed becomes
fire : and conversely fire contracted and quenched returns again
to the form of air; also air concentrating and condensing
becomes cloud and mist ; and from these yet further com-
pressed comes flowing water ; and from water earth and stones
once more : and so, it appears, they hand on one to another
the cycle of generation. Thus then since these several bodies
never assume one constant form, which of them can we posi-
tively affirm to be really this and not another without being
shamed in our own eyes ? It cannot be : it is far the safest
course when we make a statement concerning them to speak
as follows. What we see in process of perpetual transmutation,
as for instance fire, we must not call this, but such-tike is the
appellation we must confer on fire ; nor must we call water
this, but always such; nor must we apply to anything, as if
it had any stability, such predicates as we express by the
use of the terms this and that and suppose that we signify
something thereby. For it flees and will not abide such
terms as this and that and relative to this, and every phrase
which represents it as stable. The word this we must not
use of any of them; but such, applying in the same sense to
all their mutations, we must predicate of each and all : fire we
must call that which universally has that appearance ; and so
must we name all things such as come into being. That
wherein they come to be severally and show themselves, and
from whence again they perish, in naming that alone must
we use the words that and this; but whatever has any quality,
such as white or hot or any of two opposite attributes, and all
combinations of these, we must denote by no such term.

But we must try to speak yet more clearly on this matter.
Suppose a man having moulded all kinds of figures out of
gold should unceasingly remould them, interchanging them
all with one another, it were much the safest thing in view
of truth to say that it is gold ; but as to the triangles or any
other shapes that were impressed on it, never to speak of
them as existing, seeing that they change even as we are in
the act of defining them ; but if it will admit the term such with
any tolerable security, we must be content. The same lan-
guage must be applied to the nature which receives into it
all material things : we must call it always the same ; for it
never departs from its own function at all. It ever receives
all things into it and has nowhere any form in any wise like
to aught of the shapes that enter into it. For it is as the
substance wherein all things are naturally moulded, being
stirred and informed by the entering shapes ; and owing to
them it appears different from time to time. But the shapes
which pass in and out are likenesses of the eternal existences,
being copied from them in a fashion wondrous and hard to
declare, which we will follow up later on. For the present how-
ever we must conceive three kinds : first that which comes
to be, secondly that wherein it comes to be, third that from
which the becoming is copied when it is created. And we
may liken the recipient to a mother, the model to a father,
and that which is between them to a child ; and we must
remember that if a moulded copy is to present to view
all varieties of form, the matter in which it is moulded cannot
be rightly prepared unless it be entirely bereft of all those
forms which it is about to receive from without. For were
it like any one of the entering shapes, whenever that of an op-
posite or entirely different nature came upon it, it would in
receiving it give the impression badly, intruding its own form.
Wherefore that which shall receive all forms within itself must
be utterly without share in any of the forms ; just as in the
making of sweet unguents, men purposely contrive, as the
beginning of the work, to make the fluids that are to receive
the perfumes perfectly scentless : and those who set about
moulding figures in any soft substance do not suffer any shape
to show itself therein at the beginning, but they first knead it
smooth and make it as uniform as they can. In the same way
it behoves that which is fitly to receive many times over its
whole extent likenesses of all things, that is of all eternal ex-
istences, to be itself naturally without part or lot in any of the
forms. Therefore the mother and recipient of creation which is
visible and by any sense perceptible we must call neither earth
nor air nor fire nor water, nor the combinations of these nor the
elements of which they are formed : but we shall not err in
affirming it to be a viewless nature and formless, all-receiving,
in some manner most bewildering and hard to comprehend par-
taking of the intelligible. But so far as from what has been said
we may arrive at its nature, this would be the most just account
of it. That part of it which is enkindled from time to time
appears as fire, and that which is made liquid as water, and as
earth and air such part of it as receives the likenesses of these.

But in our inquiry concerning these we must deliver a
stricter statement. Is there an absolute idea of fire, and do all
those absolute ideas exist to which in every case we always
ascribe absolute being ? Or do those things which we actually
see or perceive with any other bodily sense alone possess such
reality ? and is it true that there are no manner of real existences
beyond these at all, but we talk idly when we speak of an in-
telligible idea as actually existent, whereas it was nothing but a
conception ? Now it does not become us either to dismiss the
present question unjudged and undecided, simply asserting that
the ideas exist, nor yet must we add to our already long dis-
course another as long which is subordinate. But if we could
see our way to a great definition couched in brief words, that
would be most seasonable for our present purpose. Thus then
do I give my own verdict : if reason and true opinion are of two
different kinds, then the ideas do surely exist, forms not per-
ceptible by our senses, the objects of thought alone ; but if, as
some hold, true opinion differs nothing from reason, then all
that we apprehend by our bodily organs we must affirm to be
the most real existence. Now we must declare them to be two,
because they are different in origin and unlike in nature. The
one is engendered in us by instruction, the other by persuasion ;
the one is ever accompanied by right understanding, the other is
without understanding; the one is not to be moved by per-
suasion, the other yields to persuasion ; true opinion we must
admit is shared by all men, but reason by the gods alone and a
very small portion of mankind. This being so, we must agree
that there is first the unchanging idea, unbegotten and imperish-
able, neither receiving aught into itself from without nor itself
entering into aught else, invisible, nor in any wise perceptible
even that whereof the contemplation belongs to thought. Second
is that which is named after it and is like to it, sensible, created,
ever in motion, coming to be in a certain place and again from
thence perishing, apprehensible by opinion with sensation. And
the third kind is space everlasting, admitting not destruction, but
affording place for all things that come into being, itself appre-
hensible without sensation by a sort of bastard reasoning, hardly
matter of belief. It is with this in view that dreaming we say
that all which exists must be in some place and rilling some
space, and that what is neither on earth nor in heaven anywhere
is nought. All these and many kindred fancies have we even
concerning that unsleeping essence and truly existing, for that
by reason of this dreaming state we become impotent to arouse
ourselves and affirm the truth ; namely, that to an image it
belongs, seeing that it is not the very model of itself, on which
itself has been created, but is ever the fleeting semblance of
another, in another to come into being, clinging to existence as
best it may, on pain of being nothing at all ; but to the really
existent essence reason in all exactness true comes as an ally,
declaring that so long as one thing is one and another thing
is other, neither of them shall come to be in the other, so that
the same becomes at once one and two.

XIX. Such then is the statement for which I give my
sentence, as we have briefly reasoned it out: that there are
Being and Space and Becoming, three in number with threefold
nature, even before the heavens were created. And the nurse
of becoming, being made liquid and fiery and putting on the
forms of earth and air, and undergoing all the conditions that
attend thereupon, displays to view all manner of semblances ;
and because she is filled with powers that are not similar nor
equivalent, she is at no part of her in even balance, but being
swayed in all directions unevenly, she is herself shaken by the
entering forms, and by her motion shakes them again in turn :
and they, being thus stirred, are carried in different directions
and separated, just as by sieves and instruments for winnowing
corn the grain is shaken and sifted, and the dense and heavy
parts go one way, and the rare and light are carried to a different
place and settle there. Even so when the four kinds are shaken
by the recipient, which by the motion she has received acts as
an instrument for shaking, she separates the most dissimilar
elements furthest apart from one another, and the most similar
she draws chiefly together ; for which cause these elements had
different regions even before the universe was ordered out of
them and created. Before that came to pass all these things
were without method or measure ; but when an essay was being
made to order the universe, first fire and water and earth and air,
which had certain vestiges of their own nature, yet were alto-
gether in such a condition as we should expect for everything
when God is not in it, being by nature in the state we have said,
were then first by the creator fashioned forth with forms and
numbers. And that God formed them to be most fair and perfect,
not having been so heretofore, must above all things be the
foundation whereon our account is for ever based. But now the
disposition of each and their generation is what I must strive to
make known to you in speech unwonted : but seeing ye are no
strangers to the paths of learning, through which my sayings
must be revealed to you, ye will follow me.

XX. In the first place, that fire and earth and water and air
are material bodies is evident to all. Every form of body has
depth: and depth must be bounded by plane surfaces. Now
every rectilinear plane is composed of triangles. And all
triangles are derived from two triangles, each having one right
angle and the others acute: and one triangle has on each side a
moiety of a right angle marked off by equal sides, the other
has it divided into unequal parts by unequal sides. These
we conceive to be the basis of fire and the other bodies, follow-
ing up the probable account which is concerned with necessity:
but the principles yet more remote than these are known but to
God and to whatsoever man is a friend of God. Now we must
declare what are the four fairest bodies that could be created,
unlike one another, but capable, some of them, of being gene-
rated out of each other by their dissolution : for if we succeed in
this, we have come at the truth concerning earth and fire
and the intermediate proportionals. For we will concede to
no one that there exist any visible bodies fairer than these, each
after its own kind. We must do our diligence then to put
together these four kinds of bodies most excellent in beauty,
and so we shall say that we have a full comprehension of their
nature.

Now of the two triangles the isosceles has but one kind,
but the scalene an endless number. Out of this infinite multi-
tude then we must choose the fairest, if we are to begin upon
our own principles. If then any man can tell of a fairer kind
that he has selected for the composition of these bodies, it
is no enemy but a friend who vanquishes us : however of
all these triangles we declare one to be the fairest, passing
over the rest; that namely of which two conjoined form an
equilateral triangle. The reason it were too long to tell : but if
any man convict us in this and find that it is not so, the
palm is ready for him with our right good will. Let then
two triangles be chosen whereof the substance of fire and of the
other elements has been wrought ; the one isosceles, the other
always having the square on the greater side three times
the square on the lesser. And now we must more strictly define
something which we expressed not quite clearly enough before.
For it appeared as though all the four classes had generation
through each other and into each other, but this appearance was
delusive. For out of the triangles we have chosen arise four
kinds, three from one of them, that which has unequal sides,
and the fourth one alone composed of the isosceles triangle. It
is not then possible for all of them by dissolution to pass
one into another, a few large bodies being formed of many
small, and the converse: but for three of them it is possible.

For since they all arise from one basis, when the larger bodies
are broken up, a number of small ones will be formed from
the same elements, putting on the shapes proper to them;
and again when a number of small bodies are resolved into
their triangles, they will become one in number and constitute a
single large body of a different form. So much for their gene-
ration into one another : the next thing will be to say what
is the form in which each has been created, and by the com-
bination of what numbers. We will begin with the form which
is simplest and smallest in its construction. Its element is the
triangle which has the hypotenuse double of the shorter side
in length. If a pair of these are put together so that their
hypotenuses coincide, and this is done three times, in such
a way that the hypotenuses and the shorter sides meet in
one point as a centre, thus one equilateral triangle has been
formed out of the other six triangles: and if four equilateral
triangles are combined, so that three plane angles meet in
a point, they make at each point one solid angle, that which
comes immediately next to the most obtuse of plane angles;
and when four such angles are produced there is formed the first
solid figure, dividing its whole surface into four equal and similar
parts. The second is formed of the same triangles in sets of
eight equilateral triangles, bounding every single solid angle by
four planes ; and with the formation of six such solid angles the
second figure is also complete. The third is composed of 120
of the elementary triangles united, and of twelve solid angles,
each contained by five plane equilateral triangles ; and it has
twenty equilateral surfaces. And the first element, when it had
generated these figures, had done its part : the isosceles triangle
generated the fourth, combined in sets of four, with the right
angles meeting at the centre, thus forming a single square. Six
of these squares joined together formed eight solid angles, each
produced by three plane right angles : and the shape of the
body thus formed was cubical, having six square planes for its
surfaces. And whereas a fifth figure yet alone remained, God
used it for the universe in embellishing it with signs.

XXI. Now if any man, reflecting upon all these things,
should fairly ask himself whether the number of cosmic systems
is indefinite or definite, he would deem that to believe them in-
definite was the opinion of one who thought very indefinitely on
a matter where he ought to be most definitely informed : but
whether we ought to say that there is but one, or that there are
really in nature five, he might, if he stopped short there, with
more justice feel doubtful. Our verdict declares that according
to the probable theory it is by nature one ; another however,
looking to some other guide, may have a different view. But
no more of him ; let us assign the figures that have come into
being in our theory to fire and earth and water and air. To
earth let us give the cubical form ; for earth is least mobile
of the four and most plastic of bodies : and that substance must
possess this nature in the highest degree which has its bases
most stable. Now of the triangles which we assumed as our
starting-point that with equal sides is more stable than that
with unequal ; and of the surfaces composed of the two triangles
the equilateral quadrangle necessarily is more stable than the
equilateral triangle, both in its parts and as a whole. There-
fore in assigning this to earth we preserve the probability of our
account ; and also in giving to water the least mobile and to fire
the most mobile of those which remain ; while to air we give
that which is intermediate. Again we shall assign the smallest
figure to fire, and the largest to water and the intermediate to
air: and the keenest to fire, the next to air, and the third to
water. Now among all these that which has the fewest bases
must naturally in all respects be the most cutting and keen of
all, and also the most nimble, seeing it is composed of the small-
est number of similar parts; and the second must have these
same qualities in the second degree, and the third in the third
degree. Let it be determined then, according to the right ac-
count and the probable, that the solid body which has taken
the form of the pyramid is the element and seed of fire ; and
the second in order of generation let us say to be that of air, and
the third that of water. Now all these bodies we must conceive
as being so small that each single body in the several kinds
cannot for its smallness be seen by us at all ; but when many
are heaped together, their united mass is seen : and we must
suppose that the due proportion in respect of their multitude
and motions and all their other powers, when God had com-
pleted them with all perfection, in so far as the nature of neces-
sity, consenting and yielding to persuasion, suffered, were every-
where by him ordained in fitting measure.

XXII. From all that we have already said in the matter of
these four kinds, the facts would seem to be as follows. When
earth meets with fire and is dissolved by the keenness of it, it
would drift about, whether it were dissolved in fire itself, or in
some mass of air or water, until the parts of it meeting and again
being united became earth once more ; for it never could pass
into any other kind. But when water is divided by fire or by
air, it may be formed again and become one particle of fire and
two of air : and the divisions of air may become for every particle
broken up two particles of fire. And again when fire is caught
in air or in waters or in earth, a little in a great bulk, moving
amid a rushing body, and contending with it is vanquished and
broken up, two particles of fire combine into one figure of
air: and when air is vanquished and broken small, from two
whole and one half particle one whole figure of water will be
composed. Let us also reckon it once again thus : when any
of the other kinds is intercepted in fire and is divided by it
through the sharpness of its angles and its sides, if it forms into
the shape of fire, it at once ceases from being divided : for a
kind which is uniform and identical, of whatever sort it be, can
neither be the cause of any change nor can it suffer any from
that which is identical and uniform with itself; but so long as
passing into another kind a lesser bulk contends with the
greater, it ceases never from being broken. And when the
smaller figures few in number are caught in a multitude of
larger figures and are being broken in pieces and quenched, if
they consent to combine into the form of the stronger they
then and there cease from being quenched ; and from fire arises
air, from air water. But if they assail the others, and another
sort meet and contend with them, they cease not from being
shattered until, being entirely repelled and dissolved, they find
refuge with some of their own kind, or being overcome, form
from many of their own figures one similar to the victorious
element, and there remain and abide with it. Moreover on
account of these conditions they all are changing their places ;
for the bulk of every kind are sorted into separate regions of
their own through the motion of the recipient : and those which
are altered from their own nature and made like some other
are carried by reason of this movement to the region proper to
the element to which they are assimilated.

All unmixed and primary bodies have thus come into being
through the causes we have described : but for the fact that
within the several classes different kinds exist we must assign as
its cause the structure of the elementary triangles ; it does not
originally produce in each kind of triangle one and the same
size only, but some greater and some less ; and there are just so
many sizes as there are kinds in the classes : and when these
are mixed up with themselves or with one another, an endless
diversity arises, which must be examined by those who would
put forward a probable theory concerning nature.

XXIII. Now concerning rest and motion, how they arise
and under what conditions, we must come to an agreement, else
many difficulties will stand in the way of our argument that is
to follow. This has been already in part set forth, but we have
yet to add that in uniformity no movement will ever exist. For
that what is to be moved should exist without that which is to
move it, or what is to move without that which is to be moved,
is difficult or rather impossible : but without these there can be
no motion, and for these to be uniform is not possible. So
then let us always assign rest to uniformity and motion to its
opposite. Now the opposite of uniformity is caused by in-
equality ; and of inequality we have discussed the origin. But
how it comes to pass that all bodies are not sorted off into
their several kinds and cease from passing through one another
and changing their place, this we have not explained. Let us
put it again in this way. The revolution of the whole, when it
had embraced the four kinds, being circular, with a natural
tendency to return upon itself, compresses everything and suffers
no vacant space to be left. Therefore fire penetrates most of
all through all things, and in the second degree air, since it is
second in fineness, and the rest in proportion. For the sub-
stances which are formed of the largest parts have the most
void left in their structure, and those made of the smallest have
the least. Now the constriction of this contracting force thrusts
the small particles into the interspaces between the larger : so
that when small are set side by side with great, and the lesser
particles divide the greater, while the greater compress the
smaller, all things keep rushing backwards and forwards to their
own region; since in changing its bulk each changes its proper
position in space. Thus owing to these causes a perpetual dis-
turbance of uniformity is always kept up and so preserves the
perpetual motion of matter now and henceforth without cessation.
XXIV. Next we must remember that of fire there are many
kinds: for instance flame and that effluence from flame, which
burns not but gives light to the eyes, and that which remains in
the embers when the flame is out And so with air : the purest
is that which is called by the name of aether, and the most
turbid is mist and gloom ; and there are other kinds which have
no name, arising from the inequality of the triangles. Of water
there are two primary divisions, the liquid and the fusible kind.
The liquid sort owes its nature to possessing the smaller kinds
of watery atoms, unequal in size ; and so it can readily either
move of itself or be moved by something else, owing to its lack
of uniformity and the peculiar shape of its atoms. But that
which consists of larger and uniform particles is more stable
than the former and heavy, being stiffened by its uniformity:
but when fire enters into it and breaks it up, it loses its uni-
formity and gains more power of motion : and as soon as it has
become mobile, it is thrust by the surrounding air and spread
out upon the earth: and it has received names descriptive of
either process, melting of the dissolution of the mass, flowing
of the extension on the ground. But when the fire goes forth
from it again, seeing that it does not issue into empty space, the
neighbouring air receives a thrust, and while the liquid mass is
still mobile, it forces it to fill up the vacant places of the fire and
unites it with itself. And being thus compressed and recovering
its uniformity, seeing that fire the creator of inequality is
quitting it, it settles into its normal state. And the departure of
fire we call cooling, and the contraction that ensues on its with-
drawal we class as solidification. Of all the substances which
we have ranked as fusible kinds of water, that which is densest
and formed of the finest and most uniform particles, a unique
kind, combining brightness with a yellow hue, is gold, a most
precious treasure, which has filtered through rocks and there
congealed : and the ' offspring of gold ', which is extremely hard
owing to its density and has turned black, is called adamant.
Another has particles resembling those of gold, but more than
one kind; in density it even surpasses gold and has a small
admixture of fine earth, so that it is harder, but lighter, because
it has large interstices within ; this formation is one of the
shining and solid kinds of water and is called bronze. The
earth which is mingled with it, when the two through age begin
to separate again, becomes visible by itself and is named rust.
And it were no intricate task to explain all the other substances
of this kind, following the outline of our probable account.
For if we pursue this as a recreation, and while laying down the
principles of eternal being find in plausible theories of becoming
a pleasure that brings no remorse in its train, we may draw from
it a sober and sensible amusement during our life. Now there-
fore setting out in this way let us go on to discuss the proba-
bilities that lie next on the same subject.

Water mingled with fire, such as is rare and liquid (owing to
its mobility and its way of rolling along the ground, which gets
it the name of liquid), and is also soft, because its bases give way,
being less stable than those of earth, when relinquished by fire
and deserted of air, becomes more uniform and is compressed
by the outgoing elements ; thus it is congealed, and when above
the earth this process takes place in an extreme degree, the result
is hail ; if upon the earth, it is ice : but when the process has not
gone so far but leaves it half-congealed, above the earth it is snow,
and when congealed from dew upon the earth, it is called hoar-
frost. Most forms of water, which are intermingled with one
another, filtered through the plants of the earth, are called by the
class-name of saps ; but owing to their intermixture they are all of
diverse natures and the great multitude of them are accordingly
unnamed : four kinds however which are of a fiery nature, being
more conspicuous, have obtained names : one that heats the soul
and body together, namely wine ; next a kind which is smooth
and divides the visual current and therefore appears bright and
shining to view and glistening, I mean the class of oils, resin
and castor oil and olive oil itself and all others that have the
same properties ; thirdly that which expands the contracted
pores of the mouth to their natural condition, and by this
property produces sweetness to the taste, of this honey is the
most general appellation ; lastly that which corrodes the flesh
by burning, a sort of frothy substance, distinct from all the other
saps, which has been named verjuice.

XXV. Of the different kinds of earth, that which is strained
through water becomes a stony mass in the following way.
When the commingled water is broken up in the mixing, it
changes into the form of air ; and having become air it darts up
to its own region. Now there was no void surrounding it ; ac-
cordingly it gives a thrust to the neighbouring air. And the air,
being weighty, when it is thrust and poured around the mass of
earth, presses it hard and squeezes it into the spaces which the
new-made air quitted. Thus earth, when compressed by air
into a mass that will not dissolve in water, forms stone ; of
which the transparent sort made of equal and uniform particles
is fairer, while that of the opposite kind is less fair. But that
which is suddenly deprived of all its moisture by the rapid
action of fire and is become more brittle than the first forms
the class to which we have given the name of earthenware.
Again when some moisture is left behind, earth, after having
been fused by fire and again cooled, becomes a certain stone
of a black colour. There are also two sorts which in the
same manner after the admixture are robbed of a great part
of the water, being formed of the finer particles of earth with
a saline taste, and becoming only half solid and soluble
again by water; of these what purifies from oil and earth is
alkali ; while that which easily blends with all the combinations
of tastes on the palate is, in the words of the ordinance, the god-
beloved substance of salt. The bodies which are composed of
earth and water combined cannot be dissolved by water, but
by fire alone for the following reason. A mass of earth is
resolved neither by fire nor by air, because their atoms are
smaller than the interstices in its structure, so that they have
abundant room to move in and do not force their way, wherefore
instead of breaking it up they leave it undissolved : but whereas
the parts of water are larger, they make their passage by force
and dissolve the mass by breaking it up. Earth then, when it
is not forcibly solidified, is thus dissolved by water only; but
when it is solidified, only by fire, for no entrance is left except
to fire. And of water the most forcible congelation is melted by
fire alone, but the more feeble both fire and air break up ; the
latter by the interstices, the former by the triangles as well. Air,
when forcibly condensed, can only be resolved into the ele-
mentary triangles, and when uncondensed fire alone dissolves
it. In the case of a substance formed of water and earth com-
bined, so long as water occupies the spaces in it that are
forcibly compressed, the particles of water arriving from without
find no entrance but simply flow round and leave the whole
bulk undissolved; but those of fire enter into the interstices of the
water, and acting upon it as water does upon earth, can alone
cause the combined mass to melt and become liquid. In this
class those which have less water than earth are all kinds of glass
and all stones that are called fusible; and those which contain
more water include all formations like wax and frankincense.

XXVI. Now all the manifold forms that arise from diverse
shapes and combinations and changes from one to another have
been pretty fully set forth; next we must try to explain their
affections and the causes that lead to them. First we must
assign to all the substances we have described the property of
causing sensation. But the origin of flesh and all that belongs
to it and of the mortal part of soul we have not yet discussed.

Now this cannot be adequately dealt with apart from the
affections of sense, nor yet can the latter without the former ;
yet to treat them both at once is hardly possible. We must
assume one side then, and afterwards we will return to examine
what we assumed. In order then that the properties of the
several elements may be discussed in due order, let us first as-
sume the nature of body and soul. First then let us see what
we mean by calling fire hot ; which we must consider in the
following way, remembering the power of dividing and cutting
which fire exercises upon our body. That the sensation is a
sharp one we are all well enough aware : and the fineness of
the edges and sharpness of the angles, besides the smallness
of its particles and the swiftness of its motion, all of which
qualities combine to render it so vehement and piercing as
keenly to cut whatever meets it all this we must take into
account, remembering the nature of its figure, that this more
than any other kind penetrates our body and minutely divides
it, whence the sensation that we now call heat justly derives
its quality and its name. The opposite condition, though
obvious enough, still must not lack an explanation. When
the larger particles of moisture which surround the body enter
into it, they displace the smaller, and because they are not
able to pass into their places, they compress the moisture within
us ; and whereas it was irregular and mobile, they render it
immovable owing to uniformity and contraction, and so it
becomes rigid. And what is against nature contracted in
obedience to nature struggles and thrusts itself apart ; and to
this struggling and quaking has been given the name of
trembling and shivering : and both the effect and the cause
of it are in all cases termed ' cold '.

' Hard ' is the name given to all things to which our flesh
yields ; and ' soft ' to those which yield to the flesh ; and so also
they are termed in their relation to each other. Those which
yield are such as have a small base of support; and the figure
with square surfaces, as it is most firmly based, is the most
stubborn form ; so too is whatever from the intensity of its com-
pression offers the strongest resistance.

Of 'heavy' and 'light' we shall find the clearest explanation
if we examine them together with the so-called 'below' and
' above'. That there are naturally two opposite regions, dividing
the universe between them, one the lower, to which sink all
things that have material bulk, the other upper, to which every-
thing rises against its will, is altogether a false opinion. For
since the form of the universe is spherical, all the extreme points,
being equally distant from the centre, are by their very nature
equally extreme ; and the centre, being equally distant from
all the extremes, ought to be regarded as opposite to all such
points. This being the nature of the universe, how can one
describe any of the said points as upper or lower, without justly
being censured for using irrelevant terms ? For the centre
cannot properly be described as being above or below, but
simply at the centre ; while the circumference is neither itself
central nor has any difference between the points on its sur-
face, so that one has a different relation to the centre from
an opposite point. Since then it is everywhere uniform, how
and in what sense can we suppose we are speaking correctly
if we use terms which imply opposition ? For suppose in the
midst of the universe there were a solid body in equilibrium,
it would have no tendency towards any point in the circum-
ference, owing to the absolute uniformity of the whole : indeed
if we were to walk round the sphere, frequently, as we stood
at the antipodes of our former position, we should call the
same point on its surface successively 'above' and 'below'. For
this universe being spherical, as we just now said, no rational
man can speak of one region as upper, of another as lower: how-
ever whence these names were derived and under what conditions
we use them to express this division of the entire universe,
we may explain on the following hypothesis. In that region
of the universe which is specially allotted to the element of
fire, where indeed the greatest mass would be collected of that
to which it is attracted, if one should attain to this place, and,
acquiring the needful power, should separate portions of fire
and weigh them in scales, when he raises the balance and
forcibly drags the fire into the alien air, evidently he overpowers
the smaller portion more easily than the larger : for when two
masses are raised at once by the same force, necessarily the
smaller yields more readily to the force, the larger, owing to
its resistance, less readily : hence the larger mass is said to be
heavy and to tend downwards, the smaller to be light and
to tend upwards. This is exactly what we ought to detect
ourselves doing in our own region. Moving as we do on the
earth, we separate portions of earthy substances or sometimes
earth itself, and drag them into the alien air with unnatural
force, for each portion clings to its own kind. Now the smaller
mass yields more readily to our force than the larger and follows
quicker into the alien element ; therefore we call it ' light ', and
the place into which we force it ' above ' ; while to the opposite
conditions we apply the terms 'heavy' and 'below'. Now
that these mutual relations should vary is inevitable, because
the bulk of the several elements occupy contrary positions in
space. For as between a body that is light in one region and
a body that is light in the opposite region, or as between two
that are heavy, as well as upper and lower, all the lines of
attraction will be found to become and remain relatively con-
trary and transverse and different in every possible way. But
with all of them this one principle is to be borne in mind, that
in every case it is the tendency towards the kindred element
that makes us call the falling body heavy, and the place to
which it falls, below ; while to the reverse relations we apply
the opposite names. So much then for the causes of these
conditions. Of the qualities of smooth and rough any one
could perceive the cause and explain it to another: the latter
is produced by a combination of hardness and irregularity, the
former by a combination of uniformity and density.

XXVII. We have yet to consider the most important point
relating to the affections which concern the whole body in com-
mon ; that is, the cause of pleasure and pain accompanying
the sensations we have discussed : and also the affections which
produce sensation by means of the separate bodily organs and
which involve attendant pains and pleasures. This then is how
we must conceive the causes in the case of every affection,
sensible or insensible, recollecting how we defined above the
source of mobility and immobility : for this is the way we must
seek the explanation we hope to find. When that which is
naturally mobile is impressed by even a slight affection, it spreads
abroad the motion, the particles one upon another producing
the same effect, until coming to the sentient part it announces
the property of the agent : but a substance that is immobile
is too stable to spread the motion round about, and thus merely
receives the affection but does not stir any neighbouring part;
so that as the particles do not pass on one to another the
original impulse which affected them, they keep it untransmitted
to the entire creature and thus leave the recipient of the af-
fection without sensation. This takes place with our bones and
hair and all the parts we have which are formed mostly of
earth : while the former conditions apply in the highest degree
to sight and hearing, because they contain the greatest pro-
portion of fire and air. The nature of pleasure and pain must
be conceived thus : an affection contrary to nature, when it takes
place forcibly and suddenly within us, is painful ; a sudden
return to the natural state is pleasant; a gentle and gradual
process is imperceptible; and one of an opposite character is per-
ceptible. Now a process which takes place with perfect facility
is perceptible in a high degree, but is accompanied neither by
pleasure nor by pain. An example will be found in the affec-
tions of the visual current, which we said above was in the day-
time a material body cognate with ourselves. In this cutting and
burning and any other affection cause no, pain; nor does pleasure
ensue when it returns to its normal state : but its perceptions
are most vivid and accurate of whatsoever impresses it or what-
soever itself meets and touches. For its dilation and contraction
are entirely free from violence. On the other hand bodies
formed of larger particles, reluctantly yielding to the agent, and
spreading the motions through the whole frame, cause pleasure
and pain ; when they are disturbed giving pain, and pleasure
in being restored to their proper state. Those things which
suffer a gradual withdrawing and emptying, but have their
replenishment sudden and on a large scale, are insensible to
the emptying but sensible of the replenishment ; so that while
they cause no pain to the mortal part of the soul, they produce
very intense pleasure. This is to be observed in the case of
sweet smells. But when the parts are disturbed suddenly, but
gradually and laboriously restored to their- former condition,
they afford exactly the opposite result to the former : this may
be seen in the case of burns and cuts on the body.

XXVIII. Now the affections common to the body as a
whole and the names that have been given to the agents which
produce them have been well-nigh expounded : next we must
try to explain, if we can, what takes place in the separate parts
of us, both as to the affections of them and the causes on the
part of the agents. First then we must set forth to the best
of our p3wer all that we left unsaid concerning tastes, which
are affections peculiar to the tongue. It appears that these,
like most other things, are brought about by contraction and
dilation, besides which they have more to do than other sen-
sations with roughness and smoothness in the agents. For
whenever earthy particles enter in by the little veins which are
a kind of testing instruments of the tongue, stretched to the
heart, and strike upon the moist and soft parts of the flesh,
these particles as they are being dissolved contract and dry
the small veins ; and if they are very rough, they are termed
'astringent'; if less so 'harsh'. Such substances again as are
detergent and rinse the whole surface of the tongue, if they
do this to an excessive degree and encroach so as to dissolve
part of the structure of the flesh, as is the property of alka-
lies all such are termed 'bitter': but those which fall short of
the alkaline quality and rinse the tongue only to a moderate
extent are saline without bitterness and seem to us agreeable
rather than the reverse. Those which share the warmth of
the mouth and are softened by it, being simultaneously in-
flamed and themselves in turn scorching that which heated
them, and which owing to their lightness fly upward to the
senses of the head, penetrating all that is in their path owing
to these properties all such substances are called ' pungent '.
But sometimes these same substances, having been already
refined by decomposition, enter into the narrow veins, being
duly proportioned to the earthy particles and the particles of
air which are there, so that they set them in motion and mingle
them together, and thereby cause them to jostle against one
another and taking up other positions to form new hollows
extended round the entering particles which hollows consist
of a film of moisture, sometimes earthy, sometimes pure, em-
bracing a volume of air ; and thus they form moist capsules con-
taining air : in some cases the films are of pure moisture and
transparent and are called bubbles ; in others they are of earthy
liquid which effervesces and rises all together, when the name
of seething and fermentation is given to it : and the cause
of all these conditions is termed ' acid '. The opposite affection
to all those which have been described is produced by an oppo-
site cause : when the structure of the entering particles amid
the moisture, having a natural affinity to the tongue's normal
condition, smooths it by mollifying the roughened parts, and
relaxes or contracts what is unnaturally contracted or expanded,
and settles everything as much as possible in its natural state.
Every such remedy of violent affections is to all of us pleasant
and agreeable, and has received the name of ' sweet '.

XXIX. Enough of this subject. As regards the faculty
of the nostrils no classification can be made. For smells are
of a half-formed nature : and no class of figure has the adap-
tation requisite for producing any smell, but our veins in this
part are formed too narrow for earth and water, and too wide
for fire and air: for which cause no one ever perceived any
smell of these bodies ; but smells arise from substances which
are being either liquefied or decomposed or dissolved or evapo-
rated : for when water is changing into air and air into water,
odours arise in the intermediate condition ; and all odours are
vapour or mist, mist being the conversion of air into water, and
vapour the conversion of water into air ; whence all smells are
subtler than water and coarser than air. This is proved when
any obstacle is placed before the passages of respiration, and
then one forcibly inhales the air : for then no smell filters through
with it, but the air bereft of all scent alone follows the inhala-
tion. For this reason the complex varieties of odour are un-
named, and are ranked in classes neither numerous nor simple :
only two conspicuous kinds are in fact here distinguished, plea-
sant and unpleasant. The latter roughens and irritates all the
cavity of the body that is between the head and the navel ; the
former soothes this same region and restores it with contentment
to its own natural condition.

A third organ of sensation in us which we have to examine
is that of hearing, and we must state the causes whence arise the
affections connected with it. Let us in general terms define
sound as a stroke transmitted through the ears by the air and
passed through the brain and the blood to the soul; while the
motion produced by it, beginning in the head and ending in the
region of the liver, is hearing. A rapid motion produces a shrill
sound, a slower one a deeper sound; regular vibration gives an
even and smooth sound, and the opposite a harsh one; if the
movement is large, the sound is loud; if otherwise, it is slight.
Concerning accords of sound we must speak later on in our
discourse.

XXX. A fourth faculty of sense yet remains, the intricate
varieties of which it is our part to classify. To these we have
given the name of colours, which consist of a flame streaming off
from every object, having its particles so adjusted to those of
the visual current as to excite sensation. We have already set
forth the causes which gave origin to vision: thus therefore it
will be most natural and fitting for a rational theory to treat of
the question of colours. The particles which issue from outward
objects and meet the visual stream are some of them smaller,
some larger, and some equal in size to the particles of that
stream. Those of equal size cause no sensation, and these we
call transparent; but the larger and smaller, in the one case by
contracting, in the other by dilating it, produce effects akin to
the action of heat and cold on the flesh, and to the action on
the tongue of astringent tastes and the heating sensations which
we termed pungent. These are white and black, affections
identical with those just mentioned, but occurring in a different
class and seeming to be different for the causes aforesaid. We
must then classify them as follows. What dilates the visual
stream is white, and the opposite thereof is black. A swifter
motion belonging to a different kind of fire, which meets and
penetrates the visual stream quite up to the eyes, and forcibly
displaces and decomposes the pores of the eyes themselves,
draws from thence a combined body of fire and water, which
we call a tear: and whereas this agent is itself fire, meeting
the other from the opposite direction, and one fire leaps forth
as lightning from the eyes, while the other enters in and is
quenched in the moisture, all manner of colours arise in this
commixture; and to the sensation we give the name of dazzling,
and the agent which produces it we call bright and shining. A
kind of fire which is intermediate between the two former, when
it reaches the moisture of the eye and is mingled with it, but
does not flash, produces a blood-like colour by the mixture of
fire with the gleam of the moisture, and the name we give it
is red. Bright combined with red and white makes yellow. In
what proportion they are mingled, it were not reasonable to say,
even if we knew; for there is neither any inevitable law nor any
probable account thereof which we might properly declare. Red
mingled with black and white becomes purple, which turns to
dark violet when these ingredients are more burnt and a greater
quantity of black is added. Chestnut arises from the mixture
of yellow and grey, and grey from white and black : pale buff is
from white mixed with yellow. When bright meets white and
is steeped in intense black, a deep blue colour is the result; and
deep blue mingled with white produces pale blue; and chestnut
with black makes green. And for the remaining colours, it is
pretty clear from the foregoing to what combinations we ought
to assign them so as to preserve the probability of our account:
but if a man endeavour to make practical trial of these theories
he will prove himself ignorant of the difference between divine
and human intelligence : that God has sufficient understanding
and power to blend the many into one and again to resolve the
one into many; but no man is able to do either of these, now or
henceforth for ever.

All these things being thus constituted by necessity, the
creator of the most fair and perfect in the realm of becoming
took them over, when he was generating the self-sufficing and
most perfect god, using the forces in them as subservient causes,
but himself working out the good in all things that come into
being. Wherefore we must distinguish two kinds of causes, one
of necessity and one of God: and the divine we must seek in all
things for the sake of winning a happy life, so far as our nature
admits of it; and the necessary for the sake of the divine, reflect-
ing that without these we cannot apprehend by themselves the
other truths, which are the object of our serious study, nor grasp
them nor in any other way attain to them.

XXXI. Now therefore that the different kinds of causes lie
ready sorted to our hand, like wood prepared for a carpenter, of
which we must weave the web of our ensuing discourse, let us in
brief speech return to the beginning and proceed once more to
the spot whence we arrived at our present point; and so let us
endeavour to add an end and a climax to our story conformable
with what has gone before.

As was said then at the beginning, when God found these
things without order either in the relation of each thing to itself
or of one to another, he introduced proportion among them, in
as many kinds and ways as it was possible for them to be pro-
portionate and harmonious. For at that time neither had they
any proportion, except by mere chance, nor did any of the
bodies that now are named by us deserve the name, such as fire
and water and the other elements : but first he ordered all these,
and then out of them wrought this universe, a single living crea-
ture containing within itself all living creatures, mortal and
immortal, that exist. And of the divine he himself was the
creator; but the creation of mortals he delivered over to his own
children to work out. And they, in imitation of him, having
received from him the immortal principle of soul, fashioned
round about her a mortal body and gave her all the body to
ride in; and beside her they built in another kind of soul, even
that which is mortal, having within itself dread and inevitable
passions first pleasure, the strongest allurement of evil, next
pains, that scare good things away; confidence moreover and
fear, a yoke of thoughtless counsellors ; wrath hard to assuage
and hope that lightly leads astray; and having mingled all these
perforce with reasonless sensation and love that ventures all
things, so they fashioned the mortal soul. And for this cause,
in awe of defiling the divine, so far as was not altogether neces-
sary, they set the mortal kind to dwell apart from the other in
another chamber of the body, having built an isthmus and
boundary between the head and the breast, setting the neck
between them to keep them apart. So in the breast, or the
thorax as it is called, they confined the mortal kind of soul.
And whereas one part of -it was nobler, the other baser, they
built a party-wall across the hollow of the chest, as if they were
marking off an apartment for women and another for men, and
they put the midriff as a fence between them. That part of the
soul which shares courage and anger, seeing that it is warlike,
they planted nearer the head, between the midriff and the neck,
that it might be within hearing of the reason and might join it
in forcibly keeping down the tribe of lusts, when they would in
no wise consent to obey the order and word of command from
the citadel. And the heart, which is the knot of the veins and
the fount of the blood which rushes vehemently through all the
limbs, they made into the guardhouse, that whensoever the fury
of anger boiled up at the message from the reason, that some
unrighteous dealing is being wrought around them, either with-
out, or, it may be, by the lusts within, swiftly through all the
narrow channels all the sensitive power in the body might be
aware of the admonitions and threats and be obedient to them
and follow them altogether, and so permit the noblest part to be
leader among them all.

For the throbbing of the heart in the anticipation of danger
or the excitement of wrath, since they foreknew that all such
swelling of passion should come to pass by means of fire, they
devised a plan of relief, and framed within us the structure of
the lungs, which in the first place is soft and void of blood, and
next is perforated within with cavities like those of a sponge, in
order that receiving the breath and the drink it might cause
coolness and give rest and relief in the burning. Wherefore
they made the windpipe for a channel to the lungs, which they
set around the heart, as it were a soft cushion to spring upon ;
so that when wrath was at its height therein, the heart might
leap upon a yielding substance and become cooled, and thus
being less distressed it might together with the emotions be
better enabled to obey the reason.

XXXII. But that part of the soul which lusts after meat
and drink and all things whereof it has need owing to the
body's nature, this they set between the midriff and the navel
as its boundary, constructing in all this region as it were a
manger for the sustenance of the body : and here they chained
it like a wild beast, which must yet be reared in conjunction
with the rest, if a mortal race were to be at all. To the end
then that always feeding at its stall and dwelling as far as
possible from the seat of counsel, it might produce the least
possible tumult and uproar and allow the noblest part to con-
sult in peace for the common weal, here they assigned it its
place. And knowing that it would have no comprehension of
reason, and that even if it did in some way gain any perception
of rational thoughts, it was not in its nature to take heed to
any such things, but that it would be entirely led away by
images and shadows both by night and by day, God devised as
a remedy for this the nature of the liver, which he constructed
and set in its dwelling place : and he made it a body dense and
smooth and bright and sweet with a share of bitterness. This
he did to the end that the influence of thoughts proceeding
from the brain, when the liver received outlines of them, as if in
a mirror, and exhibited reflections to view, might strike terror
into the appetitive part, whenever making use of the bitter
element akin to its own dark nature and threatening with stern
approach, diffusing the bitterness swiftly throughout the whole
liver it displayed a bilious colour, and contracting it made it
all rough and wrinkled, and reaching the lobe and the vessels
and the inlet, twisted the first from its right position and con-
torted it, while at the same time it obstructed and closed up the
two latter, thereby producing pain and nausea : and on the
other hand in order that, whenever a breath of mildness from
the reason copied off on the liver visions of an opposite kind,
giving relief from the bitterness, because it will not excite a
nature opposite to its own nor have dealing with it, but using
upon the liver the sweetness that exists therein and soothing
everything till all is straight and smooth and free, it might
render gentle and calm that part of the soul which is settled
about the liver, and might enable it to secure a sober amuse-
ment at night, enjoying divination during sleep, in recompense
for its deprivation of intelligence and wisdom. For our creators,
because they remembered the behest of their father, when he
commanded them to make the mortal race as perfect as they
were able, in this wise redeeming even the baser part of us,
that it might have in some way a hold on the truth, placed in
this region the seat of divination.

Now that divination is the gift of God to human folly, this is
a sufficient proof. No man in his sound senses deals in true
and inspired divination, but when the power of his under-
standing is fettered in sleep or by sickness, or if he has become
distraught by some divine possession. The part of the sane
man is to remember and interpret all things that are declared,
dreaming or waking, by the prophetic and inspired nature ; and
whatsoever visions are beheld by the seer, to determine by
reason in what way and to whom they betoken good or ill in
the future or the present or the past : but it is not for him who
has become mad and still is in that state to judge his own
visions and utterances ; the old saying remains true, that only
for the sane man is it meet to act and to be the judge of his
own actions and of himself. Whence has arisen the custom .of
setting up interpreters as judges of inspired prophecy : these are
themselves called prophets by some who are altogether un-
aware that they are but the expounders of mystic speech and
visions, and ought not in strict accuracy to be called prophets,
but interpreters of the prophecies.

Such is the nature of the liver and its situation that we
have described, for the purpose of prophecy as aforesaid. And
while each body has life, this organ displays the signs clearly
enough ; but when deprived of life, it is become blind and gives
the token too dimly to afford any plain meaning. And the
structure of the neighbouring organ and its position on the left
has been planned for the sake of the liver, in order to keep it
always bright and clean, as a napkin is prepared and laid ready
for the cleansing of a mirror. Wherefore whenever any im-
purities arise in the region of the liver owing to sickness of the
body, all is received and purified by the fine substance of the
spleen, which is woven hollow and void of blood. This, when it
is filled with the impurities from the liver, waxes swollen and
festered ; and again, when the body is purged, it is reduced and
sinks again to its natural state.

XXXIII. Now as concerning soul, how far she has a mortal,
how far a divine nature, and in what wise and with what con-
junctions and for what causes she has her separate habitations,
only when God has confirmed our statement can we confidently
aver that it is true : nevertheless that we have given the probable
account we may venture to say even now and still more on
further meditation, and so let it be said. But what follows
upon the foregoing is the next object of our research : this
was the manner wherein the rest of the body has come into
being.

The following is the design on which it were most fitting
to conceive that it is constructed. They who framed our race
knew the intemperance in meat and drink that would prevail
in us, and that for greed we should use far more than was
moderate or necessary. In order then that swift destruction
through sickness might not fall upon us, and that the mortal
race might not perish out of hand before coming to com-
pletion, foreseeing the danger they made the abdomen, as it is
called, a receptacle to contain the superfluity of food and drink,
and coiled the bowels round about therein, lest the food passing
speedily through should compel the body quickly to stand in
need of a fresh supply, and thus producing an insatiable craving
should render the whole race through gluttony devoid of phi-
losophy and letters and disobedient to the highest part of our
nature.

Concerning the bones and flesh and all such substances the
case stands thus. The foundation of all these is the marrow :
for the bonds of life whereby the soul is bound to the body
were fastened in it throughout and planted therein the roots
of human nature. But the marrow itself comes from other
sources. Such of the primal triangles as were unwarped and
smooth and thus able to produce fire and water and air and
earth of the purest quality, these God selected and set apart,
each from its own class, and mingling them in proportion one
with another, to make a common seed for all the race of mortals,
he formed of them the marrow ; and thereafter he implanted
and fastened in it the several kinds of soul ; and according to
the number and fashion of the shapes that the soul should have
corresponding to her kinds, into so many similar forms did he
divide the marrow at the very outset of his distribution. And
that which should be as it were a field to contain in it the divine
seed he moulded in a spherical form all round ; and this part of
the marrow he called the brain, with the view that, when each
animal was completed, the vessel containing it should be the
head. But that which was to have the mortal part of soul
which remained he distributed into moulds that were at once
round and elongated : but he called all these forms marrow ;
and from these, as though from anchors, he put forth bonds to
fasten all the soul, and then he wrought the entire body round
about it, first building to fence it a covering of bone. And
bone he formed in this way : having sifted out earth that was
pure and smooth he kneaded and soaked it with marrow, and
after that he placed it in fire ; and next he set it in water, and
again in fire, and once more in water : and thus having shifted
it many times from one to another he made it indissoluble by
either. Making use of this, he carved a bony sphere thereof to
surround the brain, but on one side he left a narrow outlet ; and
around the marrow of the neck and back he made vertebrae of
bone and set them to serve as pivots, beginning at the head and
carrying them through the whole length of the body. Thus to
preserve all the seed he enclosed it in a strong envelope, and he
made joints in it, using the power of the Other as an inter-
mediary between the parts, for the sake of moving and bending
them. But deeming that the structure of bone was too rigid
and inflexible, and that should it be inflamed and cooled again,
it would rot away and quickly destroy the seed within it, for this
cause God devised the sinews and the flesh, that binding all the
limbs together with the former he might by their tension and
relaxation round their pivots enable the body to bend and ex-
tend itself; while the flesh he designed as a defence against
heat and a shelter from cold ; and moreover that it might be,
like coverings of felt, a protection against falls, gently and easily
yielding to external bodies; and containing a warm moisture
within itself, in summer it might exude this, and spreading
dampness on the surface might diffuse a natural coolness over
all the body; but in winter on the other hand it might by its
own fire afford a fair protection against the frost that assailed
and surrounded it from without Considering this, he that
moulded us like wax made a mixture and blending of water
and fire and earth ; and compounding a ferment of acid and salt
he mingled it with them and produced soft flesh full of sap : the
sinews he composed of bone and unfermented flesh, a separate
substance having an intermediate function; and to this he added
a yellow colour. Accordingly the sinews received a power more
firm and tenacious than the flesh, but more soft and flexible
than the bones.

With these God covered the bones and marrow; and after he
had bound one part to another with sinews, he enveloped them
over all with flesh. Those bones which were chiefly inhabited
by soul, he enclosed with the smallest amount of flesh ; but
those wherein was least soul he covered most abundantly and
densely with it : moreover at the joints of the bones, save where
reason showed that it ought to be there, he put but little flesh,
that neither it might render the body unwieldy by hindering its
flexions and impeding its .motions, nor again that a dense mass
of flesh piled together, producing by its hardness a dulness of
sensation, might render the faculties of the mind too slow of
memory and hard of apprehension. Wherefore the thighs and
the shins and the parts about the hips and the bones in the
upper arms and the fore-arms and all parts of our limbs which
are without joints, and all bones which are devoid of intelligence
owing to the small amount of soul inhering in marrow within
them, all these are abundantly furnished with flesh; but those
which are the seat of intelligence have less: except in cases
where God has formed the flesh to be in itself an organ of
sensation, as for instance the tongue: in most however it is as
aforesaid; for this material nature which comes into being by
the law of necessity and is reared with us does not allow dense
bone and much flesh to be accompanied by ready and keen per-
ception. For had these two conditions consented to combine,
the structure of the head would have displayed them in the
highest degree ; and the human being, bearing upon it a fleshy
head, sinewy and strong, would have enjoyed a life twice, nay
many times as long as now, besides being much more healthy
and free from pain. But as it is, the creators who brought us to
being considered whether they should make a long-lived race
that was inferior, or one more short-lived which was nobler, and
they agreed that every one must by all means choose a shorter
and nobler life in preference to a longer but baser. Therefore
they covered the head with thin bone, but not with flesh
nor sinews, since it has no flexions. On all these grounds the
head that is set upon the body of every man is much quicker of
apprehension and understanding, but much weaker. For these
reasons and in this manner God placed the sinews all round the
base of the head about the neck and cemented them with
uniformity; and he fastened the extremities of the jaw : bones to
them just under the face; and the rest he distributed over all
the limbs, uniting joint to joint. And our framers ordained the
functions of the mouth, furnishing it with teeth and tongue and
lips, in the way it is now arranged, combining in their purpose
the necessary and the best; for they devised the incoming with
the necessary in view, but the outgoing with the most excellent.
For all that enters in to give sustenance to the body is of neces-
sity; but the stream of speech which flows out and ministers to
understanding is of all streams the most noble and excellent.
But as to the head, it was neither possible to leave it of bare
bone, owing to the extremes of heat and cold in the seasons;
nor yet by covering it over to allow it to become dull and sense-
less through the burden of flesh. Of the fleshy material as it was
drying a larger film formed on the surface and separated itself;
this is what is now called skin. This by the influence of the
moisture of the brain combined and grew up and clothed the
head all round: and the moisture rising up under the sutures
saturated and closed it in on the crown, fastening it together
like a knot. Now the form of the sutures is manifold, owing to
the power of the soul's revolutions and of the aliment; if these
contend more vehemently one with another, the sutures are more
in number; but if less so, they are fewer. Now the whole of
this skin was pricked all about with fire by the divine part: and
when it v/as pierced and the moisture issued forth through it, all
the moisture and heat which was pure vanished away; but that
which was mingled with the substances whereof the skin was
formed, being lifted up by the impulse, stretched far outwards,
in fineness equalling the size of the puncture; but owing to the
slowness of its motion it was thrust back by the surrounding air,
and being forced in and rolled up under the skin it took root
there. Under these conditions hair grows up in the skin, being
of similar nature but of threadlike appearance, and made harder
and denser by the contraction of cooling: for every hair in being
separated from the skin was cooled and contracted. Hereby
has our creator made our.head hairy, using the means aforesaid,
and conceiving that this instead of flesh should be a covering for
the protection of the brain, being light and capable of affording
shade from heat and shelter from cold, while it would be no
hindrance in the way of ready apprehension. The threefold
combination of sinew skin and bone in the fabric of the fingers,
when dried, forms out of all a single hard skin, for the construc-
tion of which these substances served as means, but the true
cause and purpose of its formation was the welfare of races not
yet existing. For our creators were aware that men should pass
into women, and afterwards into beasts; and they knew that
many creatures would need the aid of nails for many purposes :
wherefore at the very birth of the human race they fashioned
the rudiments of nails. On such reasoning and with such
purposes did they form skin and hair, and on the extremities of
the limbs nails.

XXXIV. Now when all the parts and members of the
mortal being were created in union, and since his life was made
perforce dependent upon fire and air, and therefore his body
suffered waste through being dissolved and left void by these,
the gods devised succour for him. They engendered another
nature akin to the nature of man, blending it with other forms
and sensations, so as to be another kind of animal. These are
the cultivated trees and plants and seeds, which are now trained
by culture and domesticated with us ; but formerly there existed
only the wild kinds, which are older than the cultivated. For
indeed everything which partakes of life may with perfect
justice and fitness be termed an animal; but the kind of which
we are now speaking shares only the third form of soul, which
our theory says is seated between the midriff and the navel, and
which has nothing to do with opinion and reasoning and
thought, but only with sensation, pleasant or painful, with
appetites accompanying. For it ever continues passively re-
ceptive of all sensations, and having its circulation in itself
about its own centre, it rejects all motion from without and uses
only its own ; but its nature has not bestowed upon it any power
of observing its own being and reflecting thereon. Wherefore
it is indeed alive and in no wise differs from an animal, but it is
stationary and rooted fast, because it has been denied the power
of self-motion.

XXXV. Thus did the higher powers create all these kinds
as sustenance for us who were feebler; and next they made
canals in the substance of our body, as though they were
cutting runnels in a garden, that it might be irrigated as by an
inflowing stream. And first they carried like hidden rills, under
the place where the skin and the flesh are joined, two veins
down the back, following the twofold division of the body into
right and left. These they brought down on either side of the
spine and the seminal marrow, first in order that this might be
most vigorous, next that the current might have an easy flow
downwards and render the irrigation regular. After that, they
cleft the veins around the head, and interweaving them crossed
them in opposite directions, carrying these from the right side of
the body to the left and those from the left to the right. This
they did, partly in order that together with the skin they might
form a bond to fasten the head to the body, seeing that it was
not set round with sinews on the crown ; and also that this
might be a means of distributing from each side throughout
the whole body the sensation due to the perceptions. And
next to this they designed the irrigation on a kind of plan
which we shall better discern by assuming the following premises.
All bodies which are composed of smaller particles exclude the
larger, but the larger cannot exclude the smaller. Fire is com-
posed of finer particles than any other element, whence it
penetrates through water and earth and air and whatever is
composed of them, and nothing can keep it out. This rule
must also be applied to the human belly ; when food and
drink enter into it, it keeps them in ; but air and fire, being
finer than its own structure, it cannot keep in. Accordingly
God used these two elements for the conveyance of liquid
from the belly to the veins, weaving of air and fire a network
like a fish-trap or'weel, having two lesser weels within with a
double inlet ; one of which inlets he again wove with two pas-
sages ; and from the lesser weels he stretched as it were cords
on all sides to the extremities of the network. All the inner
part of the net he constructed of fire, but the lesser weels and
the envelope he made of airy substance ; and he took the net
and wrapped it in manner following about the animal he had
moulded. The structure of the lesser weels he carried into the
mouth : and, these being twofold, he let down one of them by
the windpipe into the lungs, the other past the windpipe into
the belly. The one weel he split in two, and let both inlets
meet by the passages of the nostrils, so that when the first
inlet was not in action by way of the mouth, all its currents also
might be replenished from the second. But with the general
surface of the network he enveloped all the hollow part of our
body; and all this, seeing it was air, he now caused to flow
gently into the lesser weels, now made them flow back upon it ;
and since the body is of porous texture, the network passes
through it inward and again outward, and the beams of fire
which are confined within follow the air as it moves in either
direction : and this never ceases to go on so long as the mortal
creature holds together. To this process he who appointed
names gave, we say, the titles of inspiration and expiration :
and from this condition, both active and passive, it has come
about that our body, deriving moisture and coolness, has its
sustenance and life. For when, as the respiration passes in and
out, the interwoven fire within follows it and entering the belly
swings up and down and meets the food and drink, it dis-
solves them, and reducing them to small particles, drives them
along the channels through which it flows, pumping them into
the veins like spring-water into conduits, and so it makes the
current of the veins flow through the body as through an
aqueduct.

XXXVI. Let us once more examine the process of respira-
tion and the causes which have led to its present conditions.
These are as follows. Since there is no void into which any
moving body could enter, and since the breath issues forth
from us, the consequence is clear to every one : instead of
entering into a void space it thrusts the neighbouring matter out
of its place. And this, yielding to the thrust, drives before it
that which is immediately nearest ; and all being driven round
by this compulsion enters into the place whence the breath
came forth, and replenishing the same follows after the breath ;
and this whole process goes on like the rotation of a wheel,
because there is no void. Therefore when the cavity of the
chest and the lungs send forth the breath, they are again re-
plenished by the air surrounding the body, which penetrates
inwards through the flesh, seeing it is porous, and is forced
round in a circuit. And again when the air returns and passes
forth through the body, it thrusts the breath back again in-
wards through the passages of the mouth and nostrils. The
cause which sets this principle in action we may describe thus.
In every animal the inner parts about the blood and veins are
the hottest, as if there were a fount of fire contained in it. This
is what we compare to the network of the weel, supposing
that all the part extending from the middle to the sides
is woven of fire, but the outer part of air. Now we must
admit that the heat naturally tends outwards to its own region
and its own kin. And whereas there are two means of egress,
one out through the body, the other by way of the mouth and
nostrils, when it makes for one exit, it impels the air round
towards the other. And the air so impelled falling into the fire
is heated, but that which passes out is cooled. So the heat
changes its position and the parts about the other outlet be-
come warmer ; therefore the heat now has a stronger tendency in
the new direction, seeking its own affinity, and impels the air by
the other passage : and this, undergoing the same change and
reproducing the same process, is thus by these two impulses
converted into a wheel swaying backwards and forwards, and so
it gives rise to respiration.

XXXVII. In the same direction are we to look for the
explanation of the phenomena of medical cupping-glasses and
of swallowing and of projected bodies, whether cast through the
air or moving along the ground ; and of sounds too, which
from their swiftness and slowness seem to us shrill or deep,
sometimes having no harmony in their movements owing to the
irregularity of the vibrations they produce in us, sometimes
being harmonious through regularity. For the slower sounds
overtake the motions of the first and swifter sounds, when
these are already beginning to die away and have become
assimilated to the motions which the slower on their arrival
impart to them : and on overtaking them they do not produce
discord by the intrusion of an alien movement, but adding the
commencement of a slower motion, which corresponds to that
of the swifter now that the latter is beginning to cease, they
form one harmonious sensation by the blending of shrill and
deep. Thereby they afford pleasure to the foolish, but to the
wise joy, through the imitation of the divine harmony which is
given by mortal motions. And the flowing of all waters, the
fall of thunderbolts, and the wonderful attracting power of
amber and of the loadstone all these are due to no drawing
power, but to two causes: first there is no void, and the
atoms jostle one upon another ; secondly when they are divided
or contracted they change places and move severally towards
their own region ; and by the complication of such conditions
all these wonders arise, as will be plain to him who examines
them by the proper method.

XXXVIII. The process of respiration then, whence this
discussion arose, rests on the principles and causes which have
been set forth : fire divides the food, following the air as it
sways up and down within ; and through this oscillation it re-
plenishes the veins from the belly by pumping into them from
thence the comminuted food. In this way throughout the whole
body of all animals the streams of nourishment are kept con-
stantly supplied. And the particles of food, being freshly severed
and from kindred substances some from fruits and some from
herbs, which God planted just to be our sustenance, have all
manner of colours owing to their intermixture; but a red hue per-
vades them most of all, through the natural contrivance whereby
the fire divides the food and imprints its own hue upon it :
whence the colour of the fluid that circulates through the body
has the appearance we have described. This we call blood,
which is the sustenance of the flesh and of all the body, and
from which all parts draw moisture to fill up the places that are
left void. And the mode of replenishment and evacuation is
like the motion of all things in the universe, whereby all kindred
substances seek each other. The elements that surround us
without are constantly dissolving our substance and distributing
it to its several kinds, returning each to its own kindred : and
again the particles of blood, being minutely divided within us
and enveloped in every creature by the body, as though by a
heaven surrounding them, are forced to copy the universal
motion. Therefore each of the divided particles within us is
carried to its own kind and thus replenishes again what was left
void. Now when the loss is greater than the replenishment,
everything diminishes, but when less, it increases. The young
frame then of the entire creature, having the triangles of its ele-
ments still as if fresh from the workshop, has them firmly linked
one to another ; but the whole mass is soft in substance, seeing
that it has been newly formed out of marrow and nurtured upon
milk. Now forasmuch as the triangles of the substances com-
posing the food and drink, which enter from without and are
received within the young creature, are older and feebler than
those of the latter, it divides and subdues them with its new
triangles, and by the assimilation of a large number nourishes
and increases the animal : but when the exact outline of the
triangles is blunted, because they have been for a long time
struggling with many others, they are not able as of old to
comminute and assimilate the entering aliment, but are them-
selves easily divided by the incoming particles. At such a time
every living thing is enfeebled and wastes away; and this con-
dition is termed old age. Finally when the bonds of the tri-
angles belonging to the ma/row no longer hold to their fasten-
ings but snap asunder with the stress, they loose in their turn
the bonds of the soul ; and she, being in the course of nature
released, flies away with gladness. For all that is contrary to
nature is painful ; but whatsoever takes place in the natural way
is pleasant. On the same principle death which ensues upon
sickness or wounds is painful and violent ; but that which draws
to the natural end in the course of old age is of all deaths the
least distressing and is accompanied rather by pleasure than by
pain.

XXXIX. Now the cause whence sicknesses arise is doubt-
less evident to all. For seeing there are four elements of which
the body is composed, earth fire water and air, any unnatural
excess or defect of these or change of position from their own
to an alien region, and also since there are more than one
kind of fire and the other elements the reception by each of
an unfitting kind, and other such causes, all combine to pro-
duce discord and disease. For when any of them changes
its nature and position, the parts that formerly were cool are
heated, and those that were dry become afterwards moist, and
the light become heavy, and all undergo every kind of change.
The only way we allow in which one and the same substance
can remain whole and unchanged and sound is that the same
element should be added to it or taken away from it on the
same principle and in the same manner and proportion; and
whatsoever errs in any of these points in its outgoings or in-
comings causes a vast diversity of vicissitudes and diseases and
destructions. Next in the secondary structures which are in a
natural state of union a second class of diseases may be dis-
cerned by one who would scrutinise them. For whereas marrow
and bone and flesh and sinew are composed of the four elements,
and blood is formed of the same though in a different way, most
of the diseases arise in the manner before explained, but the
gravest afflict them with especial severity in the following way :
that is to say, when the order of their generation is reversed,
these structures are then destroyed. For in the course of nature
flesh and sinews arise from blood, the sinews from the fibrine,
owing to their affinity; the flesh from the clots which are formed
when the fibrine is separated. From the sinews and flesh again
proceeds a glutinous and oily fluid, which not only cements the
flesh to the structure of the bones and itself gives nourishment
and growth to the bone which encloses the marrow, but also so
much of it as filters through the dense substance of the bones,
being formed of the purest and smoothest and most slippery
kind of the triangles, as it distils and oozes from the bones,
irrigates the marrow. When these structures are produced in
this order, health is the result as a rule ; but when this is re-
versed, sickness ensues. For when the flesh decomposes and
returns the deliquescent matter to the veins, then is mingled
with air in the veins much blood of manifold kinds, with
diverse hues and bitter qualities, as well as acid and saline
properties ; and this contains all kinds of bile and serum and
phlegm. For as all these are going the wrong way and have
become corrupt, first they ruin the blood itself, and furnishing
no nutriment to the body rush in all directions through the
veins, paying no heed to the periods appointed by nature, but
at war one with another, because they have no gcod of each
other ; at war also with all that is established and fixed in the
body, which they corrupt and dissolve. Now when the oldest
part of the flesh is decomposed, being hard to soften, it turns
black through long-continued burning, and through being every-
where corroded it is bitter and dangerous to whatever part of
the body it attacks which is not yet corrupted. Sometimes this
black sort is acid instead of bitter, when the bitterness is more
refined away ; and again the bitter sort being steeped in blood
gains a redder hue; and when black is mingled with this, it is
greenish : sometimes too a yellow colour is added to the bitter-
ness, when new flesh is decomposed by the fire of the inflam-
mation. To all these symptoms the general name of bile has
been given, either by physicians, or by some one who in looking
at many dissimilar appearances was able to see one universal
quality pervading them all which deserved a name. All other
kinds of bile which are reckoned have their several descriptions
according to their colour. Of lymph, one kind is the mild
serum of blood, the other is an acrid secretion of black and
acid bile, when that is blended through inflammation with a
saline property : this kind is called acid phlegm. But that
which is formed in conjunction with air by the liquefaction
of new and tender flesh, when it is inflated with air en-
veloped by moisture, and through this condition bubbles are
formed, invisible separately because of their smallness, but all
together becoming visible in the mass and presenting a white
colour to view by the formation of froth this liquefaction of
tender flesh in combination with air we term white phlegm.
And the serum of freshly formed phlegm is sweat and tears,
and whatever other secretions purify the body from day to day.
All these become a means of disease, when the blood is not
replenished from the food and drink in the natural way, but
receives its volume in the contrary manner in despite of nature's
laws. Now when the flesh is anywhere pierced by disease, but
the foundations of it remain intact, the malady has only half its
power; for there is still the prospect of ready recovery. But
when that which unites the flesh to the bones is diseased, and
in turn no longer by distilling both from the fibres and sinews
nourishes the bones and cements the flesh to them, but
instead of being oily and smooth and glutinous becomes harsh
and saline and shrivelled through an unhealthy habit of life,
under these conditions all that substance crumbles away under
the flesh and the sinews and separates from the bones; while
the flesh, falling away from its foundations, leaves the sinews
bare and full of brine, and itself falling back into the current of
the blood aggravates the diseases that have been described.
But distressing as are these symptoms which affect the body,
yet more serious are those which are prior in order ; when the
bones, owing to denseness of the flesh, cannot get sufficient air
and becoming mouldy and heated decay away, and while they
will not receive their nourishment, crumble down and return by
a reversed process into their nourishing fluid, and that in its turn
passing into flesh, and the flesh into blood, they render all the
diseases more virulent than those already mentioned. The most
desperate case of all is when the substance of the marrow be-
comes diseased by any defect or excess : this produces the most
serious and fatal disorders, seeing that the whole nature of the
body is forced to proceed in a backward course.

XL. A third class of diseases we must conceive as occurring
in three ways : one by the agency of air, the second of phlegm,
the third of bile. For when the lungs, which are the dispensers
of air to the body, do not keep their passages clear, because
they are impeded by catarrhs, the air, failing to pass through
some, and in others entering with a volume unduly great, causes
the decomposition of the parts which lack their supply of air,
and forces its way through the channels of the veins and dis-
locates them, and dissolving the body it is confined amid its
substance, occupying the midriff; and so countless painful
diseases are produced from these causes, accompanied by
excessive sweat. Often too when the flesh is broken up, air
is formed in the body, and being unable to find an exit it pro-
duces the same torments as are caused by the air which enters
in ; the most severe of all, when gathering and swelling up
around the sinews and the blood-vessels in these parts it strains
the tendons of the shoulders and the muscles attached to them
in a backward direction : and owing to the intense strain pro-
duced in this condition these affections are called tetanus and
opisthotonus. For these the remedy is severe : for in fact fevers
supervening chiefly give relief in such cases. The white phlegm
when intercepted is dangerous owing to the air in the bubbles :
but when it finds an escape to the surface of the body it is more
mild ; yet it disfigures the person by engendering scabs and
leprosies and kindred maladies. Sometimes it is mingled with
black bile and is shed upon the revolutions in the head, which
are the most divine, and confounds them ; and if this occurs
during sleep, the effects are milder, but if in the waking hours, it
is harder to relieve. This, as affecting the sacred part, is justly
called the sacred disease. Acid and saline phlegm is the source
of all diseases that take the form of catarrh : and these have
received manifold names according to the diverse places in
which the discharge takes place. Inflammations in various parts
of the body, so called from the heat and burning that occurs,
are all due to bile. When they have egress, they seethe up and
send forth all kinds of pustules ; but if they are suppressed
within, they cause many inflammatory diseases ; of which the
worst is when the inflammation entering into pure blood carries
away from its proper place the fibrine which was distributed
through the blood in order that it might preserve a due measure
of thinness and thickness and neither be so much liquefied by
heat as to flow out through the porous texture of the body, nor
become sluggish from excessive density and circulate with
difficulty in the veins. Now the fibrine by the nature of its
composition preserves the due mean in these respects. For if
from blood that is dead and beginning to cool the fibrine be
gathered apart, the rest of the blood is dissipated ; but if the
fibrine be allowed to remain, by the help of the cold air sur-
rounding, it quickly congeals it. The fibrine then in the blood
having this property, bile which is naturally formed of old blood
and is dissolved again into blood out of the flesh, enters warm
and liquid into the blood, at first gradually, and is condensed by
the power of the fibrine ; and as it is condensed and forced to
cool, it produces internal chill and shivering. But when a
greater quantity flows in, it subdues the fibrine with its heat,
and boiling up scatters it abroad ; and if it is able to obtain the
mastery to the end, it penetrates to the substance of the marrow,
and consuming it looses from thence the bonds of the soul, as it
were the moorings of a ship, and sets her free. But when the
bile is too feeble for this, and the body holds out against the
dissolution, itself is vanquished, and either is expelled by an
eruption over the whole body, or is driven through the veins
into the lower or upper belly, like an exile banished from a city
that has been at civil war ; and as it issues forth from the body,
it causes diarrhoea and dysentery and all diseases of that kind.
When a body has been stricken with sickness chiefly through
excess of fire, it exhibits continued inflammations and fevers ;
excess of air causes quotidian fevers ; excess of water tertian,
because it is more sluggish than air or fire ; excess of earth,
which is by four measures most sluggish of all, being purged
in a fourfold period of time, gives rise to quartan fevers, and is
with difficulty banished.

XLI. Such are the conditions connected with diseases of the
body; those of the soul depend upon bodily habit in the following
way. We must allow that disease of the soul is senselessness; and
of this there are two forms, madness and stupidity. Every con-
dition then in which a man suffers from either of these must be
termed a disease. We must also affirm that the gravest maladies
of the soul are excessive pleasures or pains. For if a man is
under the influence of excessive joy, o,r, on the other hand, of
extreme pain, and is eager unduly to grasp the one or shun the
other, he is able neither to see nor to hear anything aright ; he is
delirious, and at that moment entirely unable to obey reason.

In whomsoever the seed in the region of the marrow is abundant
and fluid and like a tree that is fruitful beyond due measure, he
feels from time to time many a sore pang and many a delight
amid his passions and their fruits ; and he becomes mad for the
greater part of his life owing to the intensity of pleasures and
pains, keeping his soul in a state of disease and derangement
through the power of the body ; he is not however regarded as
sick, but as willingly vicious. But the truth is that incontinence
in sensual pleasures is a disease of the soul for the most part
arising from the fluid and moist condition of one element in
the body owing to porousness of the bones. So it is too with
nearly all intemperance in pleasure ; and the reproach attaching
thereto, as if men were willingly vicious, is incorrectly brought
against them. For no one is willingly wicked ; but it is owing
to some bad habit of body and unenlightened training that the
wicked man becomes wicked ; and these are always unwelcome
and imposed against his will. And where pains are concerned,
the soul likewise derives much evil from the body. For where
the humours of acid and salt phlegms and those that are bitter
and bilious roam about the body and find no outlet to the sur-
face, but being pent up within and blending their own exhala-
tions with the movement of the soul are mingled therewith, they
induce all kinds of mental diseases, more or less violent and
serious : and rushing to the three regions of the soul, in the part
which each attacks they multiply manifold forms of moroseness
and melancholy, of rashness and timidity, of forgetfulness and
dulness. And when, besides these vicious conditions, there are
added bad governments and bad principles maintained in public
and private speech ; when moreover no studies to be an antidote
are pursued from youth up, then it is that all of us who are
wicked become so, owing to two causes entirely beyond our own
control. The blame must lie rather with those who train than
with those who are trained, with the educators than the educa-
ted : however we must use our utmost zeal by education, pur-
suits, and studies to shun vice and embrace virtue. This subject
however belongs to a different branch of inquiry.

XLII. The counterpart to what has been said, the treatment
of body and mind and the principles by which they are pre-
served, were the proper and fitting complement of our dis-
course : for it is more just to dwell upon good than upon evil.
All that is good is fair, and what is fair is not disproportionate.
Accordingly an animal that is to be fair must, we affirm, be
well-proportioned. Now the smaller proportions we discern and
reason upon them ; but of the greatest and most momentous we
take no account. For in view of health and sickness and virtue
and vice no proportion or disproportion is more important than
that existing between body and soul themselves : yet we pay no
heed to these, nor do we reflect that if a feebler and smaller
frame be the vehicle of a soul that is strong and mighty in all
respects; or if the relation between the two be reversed, then
the entire creature is not fair ; for it is defective in the most
essential proportions. But the opposite condition is to him who
can discern it of all sights the fairest and loveliest. For ex-
ample, a body which possesses legs of excessive length or which
is unsymmetrical owing to any other disproportion, is not only
ugly, but in taking its share of labour brings infinite distress
on itself, suffering frequent fatigue and spasms, and often falling
in consequence of inability to control its motions: the same
then we must suppose to hold good of the combination of soul
and body which we call an animal ; when the soul in it is more
powerful than the body and of ardent temperament, she agitates it
and fills it from within with sickness; and when she impetuously
pursues some study or research, she wastes the body away :
and in giving instruction and conducting discussions private or

public in a spirit of contention and rivalry, she inflames and
weakens its fabric and brings on chills ; and thus deceiving most
of the so-called physicians induces them to assign causes for the
malady which are really in no way concerned with it. When on
the other hand a large body, too great for the soul, is joined
with a small and feeble mind, two kinds of appetites being
natural to mankind, on account of the body a craving for nourish-
ment and on account of the divinest part of us for knowledge
the motions of the stronger prevail and strengthen their faculty,
but that of the soul they render dull and slow of learning and of
recollection, and so produce stupidity, the most grievous of
maladies. There is but one safeguard against both these mis-
fortunes : neither should the soul be exercised without the body
nor the body without the soul, in order that they may be a
match for each other and attain balance and health. So the
mathematician, or whosoever is intensely absorbed in any intel-
lectual study, must allow corresponding exercise to his body,
submitting to athletic training ; while he who is careful in forming
his body must in turn give due exercise to his soul, calling in
the aid of art and of all philosophy, if he is justly to be called
at once fair and in the true sense good. The same treatment
too should be applied to the separate parts, in imitation of the
fashion of the All. For as the body is inflamed and cooled
within by the particles that enter, and again is dried and
moistened by those that are outside, and by the agency of these
two forces suffers all that ensues upon these conditions, if we
submit the body passively to the forces aforesaid, it is overcome
and destroyed : but if we imitate what we have called the fostress
and nurse of the All, and allow the body, if possible, never to be
inactive, but keep it astir and, exciting continual vibrations in it,
furnish it with the natural defence against the motions from
without and within ; and by moderately exercising it bring into
orderly relation with each other according to their affinities
the affections and particles that are going astray in the body ;
then, as we have already described in speaking of the universe,
we shall not suffer mutually hostile particles to be side by side
and to engender discord and disease in the body, but we shall
set friend beside friend so as to bring about a healthy state.
Of all motions that which arises in any body by its own action
is the best (for it is most nearly allied to the motion of thought
and of the All), but that which is brought about by other
agency is inferior ; and the worst of all is that which, while the
body is lying still, is produced by other agents which move
it piecemeal. Accordingly of all modes of purifying and
restoring the body gymnastic is the best ; the next best is
any swinging motion such as of sailing or any other con-
veyance of the body which does not tire it: a third kind is
useful sometimes under absolute necessity, but in no other cir-
cumstances should be employed by a judicious person, I mean
medical purgation effected by drugs. No disease, not in-
volving imminent danger, should be irritated by drugs. For
every form of sickness has a certain correspondence to the
nature of living creatures. Their constitution is so ordered as
to have definite periods of life both for the kind and for the
individual, which has its own fixed span of existence, always
excepting inevitable accidents. For the triangles of each
creature are composed at the very outset with the capacity of
holding out for a certain definite time ; beyond which its life
cannot be prolonged. The same applies also to the constitution
of diseases ; if these are interfered with by medicine to the dis-
regard of their appointed period, it often happens that a few
slight maladies are rendered numerous and grave. Wherefore
we should guide all such sicknesses by careful living, so far as
we have time to attend to it, and not provoke a troublesome
mischief by medical treatment.

XLIII. Now so far as concerns the animate creature and
the bodily part of it, how a man, guiding the latter and by him-
self being guided, should live a most rational life, let this dis-
cussion suffice. But the part which is to guide the body must
beforehand be trained with still greater care to be most perfect
and efficient for education. To deal with this subject minutely
would in itself be a sufficient task : but if we may merely touch
upon it in conformity with our previous discourse, we should
find a consistent answer to the question from the following
reflections. As we have often said, three forms .of soul with
threefold functions are implanted in us, and each of these has its
proper motions. Accordingly we may say as briefly as possible
that whichever of these continues in idleness and keeps its own
motions inactive, this must needs become the weakest ; but that
which is in constant exercise waxes strongest : wherefore we
must see that they exercise their motions in due proportion.
As to the supreme form of soul that is within us, we must
believe that God has given it to each of us as a guiding genius
even that which we say, and say truly, dwells in the summit of
our body and raises us from earth towards our celestial affinity,
seeing we are of no earthly, but of heavenly growth : since to
heaven, whence in the beginning was the birth of our soul, the
diviner part attaches the head or root of us and makes our whole
body upright. Now whoso is busied with appetites or ambitions
and labours hard after these, all the thoughts of his heart must
be altogether mortal ; and so far as it is possible for him to be-
come utterly mortal, he falls no whit short of this ; for this is
what he has been fostering. But he whose heart has been set
on the love of learning and on true wisdom, and has chiefly
exercised this part of himself, this man must without fail have
thoughts that are immortal and divine, if he lay hold upon
the truth ; and so far as it lies in human nature to possess im-
mortality, he lacks nothing thereof; and seeing that he ever
cherishes the divinest part and keeps in good estate the guardian
spirit that dwells in him, he must be happy above all. And the
care of this is always the same for every man, to wit that he
assign to every part its proper exercise and nourishment. To
the divine part of us are akin the thoughts and revolutions of
the All : these every man should follow, restoring the revolu-
tions in the head, that are marred through our earthly birth, by
learning to know the harmonies and revolutions of the All, so as
to render the thinking soul like the object of its thought ac-
cording to her primal nature : and when he has made it like, so
shall he have the fulfilment of that most excellent life that was
set by the gods before mankind for time present and time to
come.

XLIV. Thus then the task laid upon us at the begin-
ning, to set forth the nature of the universe down to the gene-
ration of man, seems wellnigh to have reached its fulfilment.
For the manner of the generation of other animals we may deal
with in brief, so there be no need to speak at length : thus shall
we in our own eyes preserve due measure in our account of
them. Let us then state it in this way. Of those who were
born as men, such as were cowardly and spent their life in
unrighteousness, were, according to the probable account, trans-
formed into women at the second incarnation. At that time
the gods for these reasons invented the love of sexual inter-
course, in that they created one kind of animate nature in men
and another in women, which two they formed in the following
way. To the channel of the drink, where it receives the fluid
passing down through the lungs beneath the kidneys into the
bladder and sends it forth by pressure of the air, they opened a
passage into the column of marrow which runs from the head
down the neck and along the spine, and which we have already
termed the seed. This, being quick with soul and finding an
outlet, gave to the part where it found the outlet a lively desire
of egress and produced a longing to generate. Wherefore the
nature of the generative part in man is disobedient and head-
strong, like a creature that will not listen to reason, and en-
deavours to have all its will because of its frantic passions ; and
again for the same reason what is called the matrix and womb
in women, which is in them a living nature appetent of child-
bearing, when it is a long time fruitless beyond the due season,
is distressed and sorely disturbed, and straying about in the
body and cutting off the passages of the breath it impedes
respiration and brings the sufferer into the extremest anguish
and provokes all manner of diseases besides ; until the passion
and love of both unite them, and, as it were plucking fruit from
a tree, sow in the womb, as if in a field, living things invisible
for smallness and unformed, and again separating them nourish
them within till they grow large, and finally bringing them to
light complete the birth of a living creature. Such is the nature
of women and all that is female. The tribe of birds was trans-
formed, by growing feathers instead of hair, from men that were
harmless but light-minded ; who were students of the heavenly
bodies, but fancied in their simpleness that the demonstrations
were most sure concerning them which they obtained through
the sight. And the race of brutes that walk on dry land comes
from those who sought not the aid of philosophy at all nor
inquired into the nature of the universe, because they used no
longer the revolutions in the head, but followed as their guides
the parts of the soul that are in the breast. From these practices
their front limbs and their heads were by their natural affinity
drawn towards the ground and there supported ; and their heads
were lengthened out and took all sorts of forms, just as the orbits
in each were crushed out of shape through disuse. For the same
reason such races were made four-footed and many-footed ; for
God gave many props to the more senseless creatures, that
they might the more be drawn earthward. As to the most
senseless of all, whose whole bodies were altogether stretched
at length on the earth, seeing they had no longer any need
of feet, God made them footless to crawl upon the ground. And
the fourth class that lives in the water was formed of the most
utterly foolish and senseless of all, whom they that transfigured
them thought not worthy even of pure respiration, because their
soul was polluted with all manner of iniquity ; but in place of
inhaling the fine pure element of air they were thrust into the
turbid and lowly respiration of water. Hence is the tribe of
fishes and of all shell-fish that live in the water ; which have the
uttermost dwelling-place in penalty for the uttermost folly. In
such manner then and now all creatures change places one with
another, rising or falling with the loss or gain of understanding
or of folly.

And now let us declare that our discourse concerning this
All has reached its end. Having received all mortal and
immortal creatures and being therewithal replenished, this uni-
verse hath thus come into being, living and visible, containing
all things that are visible, the image of its maker, a god per-
ceptible, most mighty and good, most fair and perfect, even this
one and only-begotten world that is.
